    "question": "Black Book starred the actress and writer of what heritage? Context: Black Book of the Admiralty: The Black Book of the Admiralty is a compilation of English admiralty law created over the course of several English monarchs' reigns, including the most important decisions of the High Court of Admiralty.  Its starting point is the Rolls of Ol\u00e9ron, which were promulgated in c.\u00a01160 by Eleanor of Aquitaine, although the \"Black Book\" is undoubtedly later.  The book itself states that the High Court of Admiralty was established during the reign of Edward\u00a0I (1272\u20131307), although more recent scholarship places the establishment at c.\u00a01360 during the reign of Edward III.  Apart from the Rolls of Ol\u00e9ron, the earliest statute referred to is the \"Liber memorandorum\" (1338), of which a separate manuscript copy is available in the archives of the City of London. Black Book (World War II): The Black Book: The Ruthless Murder of Jews by German-Fascist Invaders Throughout the Temporarily-Occupied Regions of the Soviet Union and in the German Nazi Death Camps established on occupied Polish soil during the War 1941\u20131945 alternatively The Black Book of the Holocaust, or simply The Black Book (Russian: \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 , \"Chornaya Kniga\"; Yiddish: \u05d3\u05d0\u05b8\u05e1 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05e6\u05e2 \u05d1\u05d5\u05da\u200e , \"Dos shvartse bukh\"), was a result of the collaborative effort by the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) and members of the American Jewish community to document the anti-Jewish crimes of the Holocaust and the participation of Jews in the fighting and the resistance movement against the Nazis during World War II. Books of Clanranald: The Books of Clanranald are two paper manuscripts that date to about the early 18th century.  The books are written in Classical Gaelic, and are best known for their traditional account of the history of Clan Donald.  The manuscripts are commonly referred to as the \"Red Book\" and the \"Black Book\".  The name \"Red Book\", however, may actually be a misnomer.  Although Gaelic tradition on South Uist notes a \"Red Book of MacMhuirich\", it is uncertain whether this book is identical to the surviving manuscript.  In fact, the manuscript may be partly derived from the red book of tradition.  The name \"Black Book\" may have been coined in order to distinguish it from the so-called \"Red Book\".

Most formats considered Black Book are formats used for video games or Digital Rights Management. Le Livre noir du capitalisme: Le Livre Noir du Capitalisme (\"The Black Book of Capitalism\") is a 1998 French book published in reaction to \"The Black Book of Communism\".  Unlike the latter work, \"Le Livre Noir du Capitalisme\"'s primary goal is not to try to attribute a number of victims to the political system in question.  Rather, the body of the book is composed of a series of independent works from various writers who each voice their critique on the various aspects of capitalism.  Topics covered range from the African slave trade to the effects of globalization. Black Book (film): Black Book (Dutch: Zwartboek ) is a 2006 Dutch thriller film co-written and directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Carice van Houten, Sebastian Koch, Thom Hoffman, and Halina Reijn.

    "question": "Between Greyia and Calibanus, which genus contains more species? Context: List of Amanita species: The following is a list of some notable species of the agaric genus \"Amanita\".  This genus contains over 500 named species and varieties, but the list is far from exhaustive.  The list follows the classification of subgenera and sections of \"Amanita\" outline by Corner and Bas; Bas, as used by Tulloss (2007) and modified by Redhead & al. (2016) for \"Amanita\" subgenus \"Amanitina\" and Singer for \"Amanita\" section \"Roanokenses\".  Bolding of the species name and an asterisk (*) following indicates the species is the type species of that section, with a double asterisk (**) indicating the type species of the entire genus.  Use of common names follows Tulloss (2007), Holden (2003), Arora (1986), and Lincoff (1981). Calyptocephalellidae: The Calyptocephalellidae are a family of toads found in Chile containing two genera, \"Calyptocephalella\" and \"Telmatobufo\".  The \"Calyptocephalella\" genus contains one species, \"C. gayi\", the helmeted water toad, which is a large aquatic toad weighing up to 0.5 kg .  The \"Telmatobufo\" genus contains four species, \"T. australis\", \"T. bullocki\", \"T. ignotus\", and \"T. venustus\".  All species within the family are considered threatened, with \"T. bullocki\" and \"T. venustus\" being classified as critically endangered.

With body sizes ranging from 11 - \"Leptofoenus\" species are larger than nearly all other species in Pteromalidae.  The genus bears a notable resemblance to the wasp families Pelecinidae, Gasteruptiidae, and Stephanidae. Banksiamyces: Banksiamyces is a genus of fungi in the order Helotiales, with a tentative placement in the family Helotiaceae.  The genus contains four species, which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or \"cones\" of various species of \"Banksia\", a genus in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Australia.  Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small (typically less than 10\u00a0mm diameter), shallow dark cups on the follicles of the \"Banksia\" fruit.  The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits.  The first specimens of \"Banksiamyces\", known then as \"Tympanis toomansis\", were described in 1887.  Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, \"B.\u00a0katerinae\", \"B.\u00a0macrocarpus\", and \"B.\u00a0toomansis\".  A fourth species, \"B.\u00a0maccannii\", was added in 1984. Megalurus: Megalurus is a genus of passerine bird in the family Locustellidae.  The genus was once placed in the Old World warbler \"wastebin\" family Sylviidae.  The genus contains six species also known as the typical grassbirds.  The genus is distributed from northern China and Japan, to India in the west, and Australia in the south, with most species being located wholly or partly in the tropics.  The genus is also sometimes considered to include the genus \"Bowdleria\", which holds the fernbirds of New Zealand.  The most widespread species, the tawny grassbird, ranges from the Philippines to southern New South Wales, whereas the Fly River grassbird is restricted to swampland in the southern part of New Guinea.  The natural habitat of the typical grassbirds is, as the name suggests, wet grasslands, swamps and other marshlands.  Some species exist away from water in tall grasslands, heathlands, and forest clearings.  Some species have adapted to the margins of rice fields and gardens. Greyia: Greyia is a genus of plant in family Melianthaceae.  It contains three species: Lophodermium: Lophodermium is a genus of fungi within the family Rhytismataceae.  The genus contains 145 species and has a global distribution.  Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves.  In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter.  In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens.  The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many \"Lophodermium\" species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several genera.  Some are economically important plant pathogens, such as those that cause needlecast disease in European Black Pine, Scots Pine and Red Pine in forestry and christmas tree plantations.  In these species, notably \"L. pinastri\" and \"L. seditiosum\", the fungal spores disperse and infect the pine needles in late summer, which turn brown by the following spring and then fall off. Pachyornis: Pachyornis is an extinct genus of ratites from New Zealand which belonged to the moa family.  Like all ratites it was a member of the order Struthioniformes.  The Struthioniformes are flightless birds with a sternum without a keel.  They also have a distinctive palate.  This genus contains three species, and are part of the Anomalopteryginae or lesser moa subfamily.  \"Pachyornis\" moa were the stoutest and most heavy-legged genus of the family.  The most notable species being \"Pachyornis elephantopus\" - the Heavy-Footed Moa.  They were generally similar to the Eastern Moa or the Broad-billed moa of the genus \"Euryapteryx\", but differed in having a pointed bill and being more heavyset in general.  At least one species (\"P. australis\") is assumed to have had a crest of long feathers on its head.  The species became rapidly extinct following human colonization of New Zealand, with the possible exception of \"P. australis\", which may have already been extinct by then. Calibanus: Calibanus is a genus of two species of flowering plants, both evergreen succulents from dry areas of northeastern Mexico.  The APG III classification system places it in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae. )  It was formerly included in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae) but is now separated from them, for it is polycarpic and dioecious.  Its name refers to the monster Caliban, an antagonist in Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\". Ceratozamia: Ceratozamia is a genus of New World cycads in the family Zamiaceae.  The genus contains 27 known currently living species and one or two fossil species.  Most species are endemic to mountainous areas of Mexico, while few species extend into the mountains of Guatemala, Honduras and Belize.  The genus name comes from the Greek \"ceras\", meaning horn, which refers to the paired, spreading horny projections on the male and female sporophylls of all species."

    "question": "Who was hung for assisting the attempted surrender of a defector from the American Continental Army to the British Army? Context: Benjamin Lincoln: Benjamin Lincoln (January 24, 1733 (O.S. January 13, 1732) \u2013 May 9, 1810) was an American army officer.  He served as a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.  Lincoln is notable for being involved in three major surrenders during the war: his participation in the Battles of Saratoga (sustaining a wound shortly afterward) contributed to John Burgoyne's surrender of a British army, he oversaw the largest American surrender of the war at the 1780 Siege of Charleston, and, as George Washington's second in command, he formally accepted the British surrender at Yorktown. 1st Virginia State Regiment: The 1st Virginia State Regiment was a regiment of Virginia Militia that fought during the American Revolutionary War.  The regiment was authorized by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia in December 1776 as a force of regular troops for the Commonwealth's defense.  In 1777, Virginia had difficulty meeting its quota for the regular line of the Continental Army.  As a result, in July 1777 under the command of Colonel George Gibson, the regiment began a march North to temporarily join the Continental Army in the Philadelphia Campaign.  In January 1778, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act directing that the 1st Virginia State Regiment \"now in Continental service, be continued in said service instead of the Ninth Virginia Regiment, made prisoners by the enemy in the Battle of Germantown.\"  The regiment camped at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-78 and at Middlebrook in the winter of 1778-79 and participated in the Battle of Monmouth.  The regiment remained in the service of the Continental Army until late 1779 when redeployed Virginia.  Unlike the standard division of eight found in the regular line regiments of the Continental Army, the 1st Virginia State Regiment consisted of ten companies including one of light infantry. Siege of Yorktown: The Siege of Yorktown, also known as the Battle of Yorktown, the Surrender at Yorktown, German Battle or the Siege of Little York, ending on October 19, 1781, at Yorktown, Virginia, was a decisive victory by a combined force of American Continental Army troops led by General George Washington and French Army troops led by the Comte de Rochambeau over a British Army commanded by British peer and Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis.  The culmination of the Yorktown campaign, the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict.  The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain. Benedict Arnold: Benedict Arnold (January 14, 1741 [O.S. January 3, 1740] June 14, 1801) was a general during the American Revolutionary War, who fought for the American Continental Army, and later defected to the British Army.  While a general on the American side, he obtained command of the fortifications at West Point, New York (which after 1802 would become the site of the U.S. Military Academy), overlooking the cliffs at the Hudson River (upriver from British-occupied New York City), and planned to surrender them to British forces.  This plan was exposed in September 1780.  He was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general. Battle of Germantown: The Battle of Germantown was a major engagement in the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War.  It was fought on October 4, 1777, at Germantown, Pennsylvania, between the British Army led by Sir William Howe, and the American Continental Army, with the 2nd Canadian Regiment, under George Washington. Board of War: The Board of War, also known as the Board of War and Ordnance, was created by the Second Continental Congress as a special standing committee to oversee the American Continental Army's administration and to make recommendations regarding the army to Congress.  On January 24, 1776, Congressional delegate Edward Rutledge, echoing Gen. George Washington's own concerns, suggested that a war office similar to Britain's be established.  Pressure from Washington and the large volume of military business led Congress to establish the Board of War and Ordnance on June 12, 1776.  Five delegates of Congress, initially John Adams, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Harrison, James Wilson, and Edward Rutledge, assisted by a permanent secretary, Richard Peters, composed the Board of War.  They assumed the prescribed responsibilities for compiling a master roster of all Continental Army officers; monitoring returns of all troops, arms, and equipment; maintaining correspondence files; and securing prisoners of war.  The Board of War began functioning on June 21, 1776. John Andr\u00e9: John Andr\u00e9 (2 May 1750 \u2013 2 October 1780) was a British Army officer hanged as a spy by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War for assisting Benedict Arnold's attempted surrender of the fort at West Point, New York to the British. National Memorial Arch: The United States National Memorial Arch, located in Valley Forge National Historical Park, Chester County, Pennsylvania, is a monument built to celebrate the arrival of General George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge.  Valley Forge was the military camp 18 miles northwest of Philadelphia where the American Continental Army spent the winter of 1777\u201378 during the American Revolutionary War.  Starvation, disease, malnutrition, and exposure killed more than 2,500 American soldiers by the end of February 1778. List of Continental Army units: The Continental Army was the national army of first the Thirteen Colonies, and then the independent United States, during the American Revolutionary War, established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, three days before the Battle of Bunker Hill, where it saw its first action under that title. .  The Continental Congress took a number of steps in the spring of 1775 to create the army in response to the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April and the seizure of Fort Ticonderoga in May.  The units composing the Continental Army changed frequently, especially in the first two years of the war.  From 1777 to the close of the war, the organization of the Continental Army became progressively more systematic and sophisticated.  The Continental Army that served at Yorktown in 1781 bore very little resemblance to the Continental Army that blockaded Boston in 1775. Pulaski's Legion: Pulaski's Legion was raised on March 28, 1778 at Baltimore, Maryland under the command of Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski for service with the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.  The Legion consisted of one troop of lancers, two troops of dragoons and 200 light infantry soldiers.  It was one of the few cavalry regiments in the American Continental Army."

Later, Williams also served as mayor of Portland.  The townhouses were built as a business investment, and Williams did not reside in the building.  The structure was moved in 1922.  Although always situated within the block bounded by NW 18th and 19th Avenues, and NW Couch and Davis Streets, it was originally in the block's northwest corner, \"i.e.\" at the southeast corner of the intersection of NW 19th and Davis.  In 1922, it was moved east within the same block, to the corner at NW 18th and Davis. Buchanan Township, Atchison County, Missouri: Buchanan Township is one of eleven townships in Atchison County, Missouri, United States.  As of the 2010 census, its population was 83.

Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and Parsonage: Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and Parsonage is a historic Presbyterian church located at 100 West Franklin Street at Cathedral Street, northwest corner in Baltimore, Maryland, United States.  The church is a rectangular Tudor Gothic building dedicated in 1847, with an addition in 1865.  The front features two 60 foot flanking octagonal towers are also crenelated and have louvered belfry openings and stained glass Gothic-arched windows.  The parsonage has walls of brick, heavy Tudor-Gothic window hoods, and battlements atop the roof and was built in 1857.  This church was incorporated in 1844 by a group of men from the First Presbyterian Church then located at the northwest corner of East Fayette Street and North Street (now Guilford Avenue) in downtown (later relocated in 1854 to West Madison Street and Park Avenue in Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood after selling their previous third church building of 1790-95 to the Federal Government which built a U.S. Courthouse there [to 1889, replaced again 1932] dedicated in 1860 by President James Buchanan).  They felt the need for a new church in that fast-growing northern section of the city formerly \"Howard's Woods\" of Col. John Eager Howard's (Revolutionary War commander of the famed \"Maryland Line\" regiment of the Continental Army) country estate \"Belvedere\" (mansion located at intersection of North Calvert and East Chase Streets, razed 1875) where the Washington Monument was erected with its four surrounding park squares just two blocks from their new building.  Franklin Street Church was also located on \"Cathedral Hill\" in the southern part of the community bordering downtown and across the street from the old Baltimore Cathedral (Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary) erected 1806-1821 and designed by Benjamin Latrobe.  Later in 1882-1886, philanthropist Enoch Pratt founded his central library for the new Enoch Pratt Free Library then facing West Mulberry Street at Cathedral, a block south which was replaced in 1931-33 by a new central library building encompassing the entire block and now directly across Franklin Street from the F.S.P.C.  In 1973, the two historic congregations reunited to form The First and Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and was centered at the First Church site on West Madison and Park.  The Franklin Street building was used by the merged congregation for a time and then sold to a fundamentalist independent Protestant congregation and later re-sold to the present \"New Unity Church Ministries\".  Across Cathedral Street to the northeast was the 1820s era Greek Revival home designed by Robert Mills (who also did the Washington Monument two blocks away) which later was occupied by the original Maryland Club, an exclusive Southern-leaning dining and leisure society of gentlemen, founded 1857 that was once threatened by Massachusetts Militia Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, U.S.A. when he occupied Baltimore at the beginning of the Civil War on May 13, 1861, and fortified Federal Hill with a Fort and cannons overlooking the harbor and city, \"to put a shot into it\" if he spied a reputed rebel flag flying or any discontent to declared martial law.  The Club later moved to North Charles and East Eager Streets in 1892 and mansion was later replaced by the former Central Building of the Young Men's Christian Association of Central Maryland (YMCA) which was closed in the 1980s and the building renovated as the Mount Vernon Hotel and Cafe. Nelson, New Hampshire: Nelson is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States.  The population was 729 at the 2010 census.  Nelson includes the village of Munsonville. Bennetts Bayou: Bennetts Bayou is a stream in the U.S. states of Arkansas and Missouri.  The stream source is in Howell County, Missouri, just south of US Route 160 west of Hocomo.  The stream flows southwest into Ozark County, Missouri, and under Missouri Route 142 on the east side of Bakersfield.  It then flows south through the extreme northwest corner of Fulton County, Arkansas, and into the northwest corner of Baxter County, Arkansas.  It continues to the southwest and enters the northeast arm of Norfork Lake to the east of Gamaliel, Arkansas.  The similarly named Bennetts River runs subparallel to Bennetts Bayou just to the southeast. Lobster Lake (Maine): Lobster Lake in the North Maine Woods was named because its shape resembles the outline of a lobster.  The northwest corner of the lake in Northeast Carry township resembles a curled lobster tail, while the lake extending eastward into Lobster township resembles a lobster thorax.  The larger eastern arm of the lake extending southward is \"Big Claw\" and a smaller western arm is \"Little Claw\".  Lobster Stream connects the northwest corner of the lake to the West Branch Penobscot River 1.4 mi north of the lake.  Lobster Lake and the river are at a similar elevation; so the West Branch may temporarily reverse flow through Lobster Stream into the lake during peak runoff events from the western Maine highlands along the Canadian border.  The lake has self-sustaining populations of native lake trout and land-locked Atlantic salmon; but brook trout populations are suppressed by competition from yellow perch and white perch. Sullivan's Corner Historic District: Sullivan's Corner Historic District is a historic district encompassing a historical rural crossroads in northeastern Norfolk, Massachusetts.  The 18 acre district includes Norfolk's oldest cemetery, established c. 1736, and five 18th- to early 20th-century buildings currently used as residences.  The core of the old cemetery is on the northeast corner of Seekonk and Main Streets, and the cemetery was enlarged north and east from that point in the 19th century.  Four of the five houses in the district face the cemetery across Seekonk Street; the fifth, 1 Needham Street, lies across Main Street at the corner, and is one of Norfolk's best-preserved Greek Revival buildings.  The building on the corner's northwest corner, Sullivan's Store, was built c. 1913, and is still somewhat recognizable as a corner store of the period, despite its conversion to residential use.  It is Norfolk's only commercial building from that period. Fairhope, Fayette County, Pennsylvania: Fairhope is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Washington Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States.

    "question": "A Pair of Brown Eyes and Wild Mountain Thyme is based from what artists song? Context: Wild Mountain Thyme: \"Wild Mountain Thyme\" (also known as \"Purple Heather\" and \"Will Ye Go, Lassie, Go?\")  is a Scottish folk song that was collected by Francis McPeake 1st, who wrote the song himself for his wife.  The McPeake family claim recognition for the writing of the song.  Francis McPeake is a member of a well known musical family in Belfast, Northern Ireland.  The lyrics and melody are a variant of the song \"The Braes of Balquhither\" by Scottish poet Robert Tannahill (1774\u20131810), a contemporary of Robert Burns.  Tannahill's original song, first published in Robert Archibald Smith's \"Scottish Minstrel\" (1821\u201324), is about the hills (\"braes\") around Balquhidder near Lochearnhead.  Like Burns, Tannahill collected and adapted traditional songs, and \"The Braes of Balquhither\" may have been based on the traditional song \"The Braes o' Bowhether\". A Pair of Brown Eyes: \"A Pair of Brown Eyes\" is a single by The Pogues, released on 18 March 1985.  The single was their first to make the UK Top 100, peaking at Number 72.  It featured on the band's second album, \"Rum Sodomy & the Lash\", and was composed by Pogues front man Shane MacGowan, on the melody of \"Wild Mountain Thyme\", also known as \"Will Ye Go Lassie Go,\" a song by Francis McPeake in a traditional Irish folk style. Bakhmull: Bakhmull is an Aboriginal Afghan Hound belonging to an ancient group of oriental sighthounds.  The Afghan Royal Family were the only humans who possessed this breed.  The bakhmull tazi (tazi means \" fast running sighthound\" ) is a long haired variety of sighthounds in Afghanistan.  There are two more: Luchak tazi short haired like sloughi and Khalagh tazi with moderate long hair on ears, shoulders, elbows and thighs.Bakhmull tazi has developed in the mountain areas of Mid and Central Asia - ancient Punjab, Paunchala, \"Five river land\".  This dog breed roots back presumably in the ancient Indian Harappa( Mohenjo Daro) civilization 2300 - 1700 B.C.  If translated from Pashto (Afghan) the word \"bakhmull\" means \"velvet\" due to its incredible silky velvet, long, ivory color hair of the coat, rather abundant and long on the whole body, because it is a mountain oriental sighthound, except the \"saddle\", front parts of four legs and the muzzle.  Its color is always fawn, ivory or white with a darker \"saddle\", thus it produces an impression of a fawn (yellowish) dog which coat color is protective khaki that matches sandstone and limestone of the Hindu Kush mountain landscape and deserts.  Following colors are not permissible: red, red with white spots, black and black with white spots.  Bakhmulls hunt the wild ram, ibex (wild mountain goat), hare, fox, wolf, jackal, wild big cats, in old times leopard, but never birds.  They are also good guards; they guard homes and flocks of sheep.  They hunt solo, in couples and rarely in packs.  Since the 1980s the centre of Bakhmull breeding is in Russia, \"The Blue Dale el Bark Bakhmull\" Moscow, where they are spread all over the former Soviet Republics and various regions.  The foundation stock was brought to Russia in the 70s by military men from Afghanistan.  Breed Standard for tazi BAKHMULL (aboriginal Afghan Hound) was adopted in Moscow, Russia (since Russia has become the 2nd motherland of bakhmulls) first in 1985 and later after detailed elaboration in 1997 (RFOS-RKF). A Spanner in the Works: The album includes covers of Bob Dylan's \"Sweetheart Like You\" and The Blue Nile's \"The Downtown Lights\".  The song \"Muddy, Sam, And Otis\", is his tribute to Muddy Waters, Sam Cooke, and Otis Redding.  Track 12, later released as a single featuring the Scottish Euro '96 Football Squad, \"Purple Heather\" is a folk song that normally goes by the name \"Wild Mountain Thyme\".  It is often credited as traditional, but was written by The McPeakes.  \"Leave Virginia Alone\" was written by Tom Petty and recorded for his album \"Wildflowers\", but was left off the finished album and given to Stewart instead. Crystal Gayle singles discography: American country artist Crystal Gayle has released fifteen music videos and sixty-eight singles.

    "question": "Armageddon in Retrospect was written by the author who was best known for what 1969 satire novel? Context: Kurt Vonnegut: Kurt Vonnegut Jr. ( ; November 11, 1922April 11, 2007) was an American writer.  In a career spanning over 50 years, Vonnegut published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five works of non-fiction.  He is most famous for his darkly satirical, best-selling novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" (1969). Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gironella: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gironella Pous (31 December 1917 in Darnius \u2013 3 January 2003 in Arenys de Mar) was a Spanish author best known for his fictional work \"The Cypresses Believe in God\" (\"Los cipreses creen en Dios\"), which was published in Spain in 1953 and translated into English by Harriet de On\u00eds in 1955.  The book is a novel in two parts, and is the first novel of four, written from a Roman Catholic viewpoint, by its Catholic author, who had been educated in a seminary \u2014 but whose approach is notable for its even-handedness and fair assessment of the many nuances and subtleties among all factions on the eve of war.  The story is set in Girona, a city in eastern Catalonia, and follows the life of a family, from 1931 until the Spanish Civil War breaks out in 1936.  The protagonist is the son of an atheist from Madrid, who is married to a devout Basque woman, and has a younger brother and sister also caught up in the conflict.  In a sequel to \"Cypresses\", \"One Million Dead\" (\"Un mill\u00f3n de muertos\"), translated by Joan MacLean, Gironella follows the Alvear family through the war.  The next novel is \"Peace after War\", published in English in 1969, and was also translated by MacLean.  The fourth novel, Los hombres lloran solos (Men cry alone), has not been translated and published in English. Little Big Man (novel): Little Big Man is a 1964 novel by American author Thomas Berger.  Often described as a satire or parody of the western genre, the book is a modern example of picaresque fiction.  Berger made use of a large volume of overlooked first-person primary materials, such as diaries, letters, and memoirs, to fashion a wide-ranging and entertaining tale that comments on alienation, identity, and perceptions of reality.  Easily Berger's best known work, \"Little Big Man\" was made into a popular film by Arthur Penn.  It has been called \"Berger's response to the great American myth of the frontier, representing as it does most of the central traditions of American literature.\" Hugh Gallagher (humorist): Hugh Gallagher is an author and musician from New York City.  He is best known for his satire, including his band Von Von Von, his award-winning satire on the college application essay, \"3A Essay\", and the novel \"Teeth\". The Magic Christian (novel): The Magic Christian is a 1959 comic novel by American author Terry Southern (1924\u20131995) about an odd billionaire who spends most of his time playing elaborate practical jokes on people.  It is known for bringing Southern to the attention of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who had received a copy as a gift from Peter Sellers, and subsequently hired him as co-writer for \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964) when Kubrick decided to make that film a black comedy/satire, rather than a straightforward thriller.  In 1969, \"The Magic Christian\" was made into a film starring Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr; the story was much altered and relocated from New York City to London. Joanna Russ: Joanna Russ (February 22, 1937 \u2013 April 29, 2011) was an American writer, academic and radical feminist.

She is best known for \"The Female Man\", a novel combining utopian fiction and satire, and the story \"When It Changed\". Satyricon: The Satyricon, or Satyricon \"liber\" (\"The Book of Satyrlike Adventures\"), is a Latin work of fiction believed to have been written by Gaius Petronius, though the manuscript tradition identifies the author as a certain Titus Petronius.  The Satyricon is an example of Menippean satire, which is very different from the formal verse satire of Juvenal or Horace.  The work contains a mixture of prose and verse (commonly known as \"prosimetrum\"); serious and comic elements; and erotic and decadent passages.  As with the \"Metamorphoses\" (also called \"The Golden Ass\") of Apuleius, classical scholars often describe it as a \"Roman novel\", without necessarily implying continuity with the modern literary form. Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek: Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek (] ; April 30, 1883 \u2013 January 3, 1923) was a Czech writer, humorist, satirist, journalist, bohemian and anarchist.  He is best known for his novel \"The Good Soldier \u0160vejk\", an unfinished collection of farcical incidents about a soldier in World War I and a satire on the ineptitude of authority figures.  The novel has been translated into about 60 languages, making it the most translated novel in Czech literature.  He is also known as the Obscure Czech Writer. Claudia Durst Johnson: Claudia Durst Johnson is a literary scholar best known for her work on the novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", introducing the idea of the novel's gothicism and gothic satire.  In the process of her research she befriended the author, Harper Lee.  When the city of Chicago organized a One City One Book program in 2001 based on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", Lee was unavailable to speak, so Johnson was invited to Chicago to present the book to the city. Armageddon in Retrospect: Armageddon in Retrospect is a collection of short stories and essays about war and peace written by Kurt Vonnegut.  It is the first posthumous collection of his previously unpublished writings.  The book includes an introduction by Mark Vonnegut, a letter from Kurt to his family about his experiences as an American prisoner of war in Nazi Germany, and the fire-bombing of Dresden.  Like many of Vonnegut's other books, \"Armageddon in Retrospect\" is laden with handwritten quotations and rough drawings by the author."

    "question": "What class of instrument does Apatim Majumdar play? Context: Apratim Majumdar: Apratim Majumdar (born 1978), is an Indian classical musician from Kolkata, India.  He plays the Sarod.  His \"Dhrupadee Veenkar\" style of Ustad Alauddin Khan's Seni Veenkar Gharana: analytically imaginative prosodic progression with metrical waves of melodic phrases interwoven with highest order of technical brilliance and maturity reminds the great legends of the Gharana.  He is an internationally recognized instructor of classical Indian music. Sarod: The sarod (or sarode) (\u0938\u0930\u094b\u0926) is a stringed instrument of India, used mainly in Indian classical music.  Along with the sitar, it is among the most popular and prominent instruments in Hindustani classical music.  The sarod is known for a deep, weighty, introspective sound, in contrast with the sweet, overtone-rich texture of the sitar, with sympathetic strings that give it a resonant, reverberant quality.  It is a fretless instrument able to produce the continuous slides between notes known as meend (glissandi), which are important in Indian music. Chander Bari: Chander Bari is a 2007 Bengali film directed by Tarun Majumdar.  The film centers on a middle class joint family.  The film is based on a Bengali story written by Pracheta Gupta.  Majumdar used some Rabindra Sangeets in this film. Sousaphone: The sousaphone ( ), is a brass instrument in the same family as the more widely known tuba.  Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (whom the instrument was then named after), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band.  Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or \"buzz\" into a large cupped mouthpiece.  Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player.  Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres.  Sousaphones were originally made out of brass but in the mid-20th century started to be made from lighter materials like fiberglass; today both types are in wide use. Bukkehorn: A bukkehorn (Norwegian) or bockhorn (Swedish), also called \u2033Billy Goat Horn\u2033 in English, is an ancient Scandinavian musical instrument, made from the horn of a ram or a goat.  The horn is usually made from a goat horn harvested 5 to 7 years before the instrument is crafted.  It was traditionally used by shepherds and milkmaids on summer dairy farms in the mountains, as a signal-instrument or as a scaring instrument.  When the horn later got finger holes it became possible to play melodies with it.  The instrument has two blowing-techniques: the trumpet-principle is the most common, but the clarinet-principle is also used. Experimental musical instrument: An experimental musical instrument (or custom-made instrument) is a musical instrument that modifies or extends an existing instrument or class of instruments, or defines or creates a new class of instrument.  Some are created through simple modifications, such as cracked drum cymbals or metal objects inserted between piano strings in a prepared piano.  Some experimental instruments are created from household items like a homemade mute for brass instruments such as bathtub plugs.  Other experimental instruments are created from electronic spare parts, or by mixing acoustic instruments with electric components. Udaka vadya: Udaka Vadya is an Indian musical instrument.  It is assumed either this musical instruments had been Jal tarang or similar to it.  This percussion instrument has been categorized in medieval musical treatise under Ghan Vadya (diophonic instruments where the sound is produced by striking a surface).  This instrument has been mentioned in Vatsyayana's Kamasutra, also Sangeeta Parijata of the 17th century mentioned about this instrument.  The skill to play this instrument was one of the essential 64 kala to be learnt by a woman. Keyboard glockenspiel: The keyboard glockenspiel (French: \"jeu de timbre\") or organ glockenspiel is an instrument consisting of a glockenspiel operated by a piano keyboard.  It was first used by George Frideric Handel in the oratorio \"Saul\" (1739).  It was also used in the 1739 revivals of his \"Il Trionfo del Tempo\" and \"Acis and Galatea\", and the next year in \"L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato\".  Half a century later, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart employed a \"strumento d\u2019acciaio\" in \"The Magic Flute\" (1791) to represent Papageno's magic bells, and this instrument is believed to have been a keyboard glockenspiel.  This part is nowadays sometimes taken by a celesta.  Maurice Ravel preferred the keyboard version of the instrument because it can play a true ff dynamic for brilliance and iridescence in orchestral climaxes.  In the late 20th century, the firm of Bergerault began manufacturing a three-octave (F2\u2013E4) mallet instrument with a damping mechanism operated by a foot pedal, which is capable of dealing with the wide range called for in contemporary scores. Asset classes: An asset class is a group of instruments which have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace.  We can often break these instruments into those having to do with real assets and those having to do with financial assets.  Often, assets within the same asset class are subject to the same laws and regulations; however, this is not always true.  For instance, futures on an asset are often considered part of the same asset class as the underlying instrument but are subject to different regulations than the underlying instrument. Accompaniment: Accompaniment is the musical parts which provide the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece.  There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music.  In homophonic music, the main accompaniment approach used in popular music, a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords.  In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment parts typically provide the \"beat\" for the music and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece.  The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar.  While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar).  A solo singer can accompany herself by playing guitar or piano while she sings, and in some rare cases, a solo singer can even accompany himself or herself just using his or her voice and body (e.g., Bobby McFerrin)."

    "question": " Which movie did Disney produce first,  The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh or Ride a Wild Pony? Context: The Wild Pony: The Wild Pony is a made for pay-TV movie produced in 1983 by Kevin Sullivan (\"Anne of Green Gables\") and Eda Lishman.  Sullivan and Lishman also co-wrote the screenplay based on the book \"The Year of the Black Pony\" by American author Walt Morey.  \"The Wild Pony\" has the distinction of being the first example of a Canadian film produced specifically for pay-TV.  The film, directed by Kevin Sullivan and starring Canadian Actors Marilyn Lightstone, Art Hindle and Josh Byrne, was filmed in Calgary, Alberta against the backdrop of the Canadian Rockies. Up, Down and Touch the Ground: \"Up, Down and Touch the Ground\" is a song from the 1966 musical film featurette \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\".  The song was also subsequently incorporated into the 1977 musical film, \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" which is an amalgamation of the three previous Winnie-the-Pooh featurettes including \"The Honey Tree\".  In the song Winnie the Pooh's exercise makes him hungry, and although he over-eats (it leads to his stuck-in-Rabbit's door incident later in the film), he is proud of his fat stomach and he exercises to gain weight and grow even rounder.  Halfway through the song however, he bends down too far, accidentally ripping the stitching on his bottom as a result of becoming fat, but upon seeing his bottom in the mirror, he quickly ties it together again.  By the end of the song Pooh has rationalized his over-eating by calling his hunger, \"healthy\". Little Black Rain Cloud: \"Little Black Rain Cloud\" is a song from the 1966 musical film featurette \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\".  An instrumental version is played in the next featurette \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\".  The song was also subsequently incorporated into the 1977 musical film, \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" which is an amalgamation of the three previous Winnie-the-Pooh featurettes including \"Honey Tree\".  In the song Winnie the Pooh comments about the on-screen actions where he is pretending to be a \"Little Black Rain Cloud\", as the title implies.  It's Pooh's hope that the Honey Bees will not notice him as he approaches their coveted honey. Winnie the Pooh (song): \"Winnie the Pooh\" is the title song for the franchise of the same name.  It is musically emblematic of the most successful branding Disney currently owns and has been used in most merchandising models of the brand since the song's first publication in 1966 in the musical film featurette \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\".  In film, the song is generally utilized in the title sequence.  The lyric gives an overview of the characters and the roles each plays in relation to Pooh himself.  The song has been used in every theatrically released Pooh film as well as most of the television series.  The songwriters are the Sherman Brothers, who have written the grand majority of Winnie the Pooh songs and musical numbers since 1966.  It is unknown who performed the song.  The song was also performed by Carly Simon.  A music video was released for this version and it was included in \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" DVD. Pony Penning: Pony Penning is an annual event held in Chincoteague, Virginia on the last consecutive Wednesday and Thursday in July.  The Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department conducts the event and it consists of a Wild Pony Swim on Wednesday and a Pony Auction on Thursday.  For the Wild Pony Swim, Salt Water Cowboys round up feral Chincoteague Ponies from Assateague Island and drive them across the Assateague Channel to Veteran\u2019s Memorial Park on Chincoteague Island.  The ponies swim across the channel during slack tide, when the water has minimal tidal movement.  Once on Chincoteague Island, the salt water cowboys herd the ponies to pens on the Chincoteague Carnival Grounds where some of the foals are auctioned off on Thursday. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is a 1977 American animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions and distributed by Buena Vista Distribution.  It is the 22nd Disney animated feature film and was first released on March 11, 1977 on a double bill with \"The Littlest Horse Thieves\". Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day: Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day is a 1968 animated featurette based on the third, fifth, ninth, and tenth chapters from \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" and the second, eighth, and ninth chapters from \"The House at Pooh Corner\" by A. A. Milne.  The featurette was produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution Company on December 20, 1968 as a double feature with \"The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit\".  This was the second of the studio's Winnie the Pooh shorts.  It was later added as a segment to the 1977 film \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\".  The music was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  It was notable for being the last animated short produced by Walt Disney, who died during its production. A Valentine for You: Winnie the Pooh: A Valentine for You is a Valentine's Day special based on the Disney television series \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" as well as A. A. Milne's treasured stories, originally broadcast on February 13, 1999.

It was released on VHS in 2000 and 2001 also released on DVD in 2004 and 2010. Ride a Wild Pony: Ride a Wild Pony is a 1975 American-Australian family adventure film produced by Walt Disney Productions, directed by Don Chaffey and based on the novel \"A Sporting Proposition\" by James Aldridge. The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers: \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\" is the theme song and personal anthem of Tigger, a fictional tiger from the children's book series Winnie-the-Pooh.  Although Tigger's birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year that \"The House at Pooh Corner\" was first published, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birth year as 1968, a reference to the first year that Tigger appeared in a Disney production, \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\".  That was also the same instance when Tigger first sang this song.  The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release \"Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! \", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\".  \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\" opens up the 2000 release of \"The Tigger Movie\".  In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song."

    "question": "Pandikona and Berger Blanc Suisse are both what kinds of animals? Context: Jurassic Park Builder: Jurassic Park Builder is an Apple and later Android and Facebook application produced by Ludia in 2012.  It is a construction and management simulation game in which the player builds a theme park featuring extinct animals.  Three kinds of parks can be made: \"Jurassic Park\", located on Isla Nublar, featuring dinosaurs and other Mesozoic animals; \"Aquatic Park\", located on a seabed featuring extinct aquatic animals; and \"Glacier Park\", located in Patagonia, featuring extinct animals from the Cenozoic era along with some Mesozoic crocodilians.  The game is similar to \"\" and \"\". Pandikona: The Pandikona is a primitive-type hunting dog from Pattikonda taluk-Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh state, India.  \"Pandikona\" is a medium size sight hound which is adapted to harsh climatic conditions of Kurnool district.  This breed is associated with shepherd families of that region.  PandiKona dogs need very little care. Progression of Animals: Progression of Animals (or \"On the Gait of Animals\"; Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b6\u1ff4\u03c9\u03bd ; Latin: \"De incessu animalium\" ) is one of Aristotle's major texts on biology.  It gives details of gait and movement in various kinds of animals. On the Soul: On the Soul (Greek \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2 , \"Peri Psuch\u0113s\"; Latin \"De Anima\") is a major treatise written by Aristotle c.350 B.C..  Although its topic is the soul, it is not about spirituality but rather a work in what \"might best be described as biology\" .  His discussion centres on the kinds of souls possessed by different kinds of living things, distinguished by their different operations.  Thus plants have the capacity for nourishment and reproduction, the minimum that must be possessed by any kind of living organism.  Lower animals have, in addition, the powers of sense-perception and self-motion (action) Humans have all these as well as intellect. Berger Blanc Suisse: The Berger Blanc Suisse (English: White Swiss Shepherd , German: \"Weisser Schweizer Sch\u00e4ferhund\" , Italian: \"Pastore Svizzero Bianco\" ) is a breed of dog from Switzerland.  It is of the same origins as the White Shepherd and the German Shepherd Dog, and has been recognized as a separate breed by the FCI. Piranha: Wolf In The Water: Piranha: Wolf In The Water is a 1999 educational film.  It was shown both in IMAX3D and normal versions.  It covers different kinds of piranhas and tries to uncover the mystery behind those animals, which are often described in an overly sensationalist way.  This movie is part of the Killer Instincts series, a movie series covering different kinds of predators. Prosthetic Neuronal Memory Silicon Chips: Prosthetic Neuronal Memory Silicon Chip is a device that imitates the brain's process of creating long-term memories.  This device was designed by Theodore Berger, a Biomedical Engineer and Neurologist at University of Southern California.  Berger started to work on this chip in the early 1990s.  He and his colleagues have been able to implant electrodes into rats and monkeys that restore their memories after previously being impaired.  While researchers are well into developing an actual memory prosthesis in animals, they still need to show that their chips can form long-term memories in many different behavioral situations.  Berger hopes to eventually use these chips as electronic implants for humans whose brains that suffer from diseases such as Alzheimer's that disrupt neuronal networks. Tentacle: In zoology, a tentacle is a flexible, mobile, elongated organ present in some species of animals, most of them invertebrates.  In animal anatomy, tentacles usually occur in one or more pairs.  Anatomically, the tentacles of animals work mainly like muscular hydrostats. Most forms of tentacles are used for grasping and feeding.  Many are sensory organs, variously receptive to touch, vision, or to the smell or taste of particular foods or threats.  Examples of such tentacles are the \"eye stalks\" of various kinds of snails.  Some kinds of tentacles have both sensory and manipulatory functions. Shopnopuri artificial amusement park: Shopnopuri artificial amusement park is an artificial sport for tourist situated in Dinajpur district of Rangpur division in Bangladesh.  There are Rides, Zoo, Rest house, Garden, Lakes, Fish World, \u2018Rongdhonu\u2019 Art Gallery, \u2018Moha Maya Indrojal\u2019 and central Picnic center and countless shopping area.

Anyone can enjoy his full day with family watching this artificial and natural beauties and activities.  It is also an idle Picnic spot where lots of picnic parties come every year. Ticks of domestic animals: Ticks of domestic animals directly cause poor health and loss of production to their hosts by many parasitic mechanisms.  Ticks also transmit numerous kinds of viruses, bacteria, and protozoa between domestic animals.  These microbes cause diseases which can be severely debilitating or fatal to domestic animals, and may also affect humans.  Ticks are especially important to domestic animals in tropical and subtropical countries, where the warm climate enables many species of ticks to flourish.  Also, the large populations of wild animals in warm countries provide a reservoir of ticks and infective microbes that spread to domestic animals.  Farmers of livestock animals use many methods to control ticks, and related treatments are used to reduce infestation of companion animals.  Veterinarians and animal health agencies work at private, national, and international scales to reduce the harm caused by ticks and their associated diseases."

    "question": "The Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz is associated with what type of realism? Context: Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame: The Charles S. Roberts Awards Hall of Fame, formally known as the Clausewitz Award Hall of Fame, is named after legendary military writer Carl von Clausewitz.  The recipients of this award have made an important contribution and left their mark on the contemporary hobby of military strategy games and simulations. Classical realism (international relations): Classical Realism is a theory of International Relations established in the post-World War II era that seeks to explain international politics as a result of human nature.  The theory is associated with thinkers such as Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes.  Modern thinkers associated with classical realism are Carl von Clausewitz, Hans Morgenthau and Reinhold Niebuhr.  Classical Realist thought has since been overshadowed by Neorealism after Kenneth Waltz' work became more widely accepted due to the rise of Structuralism in North American International Relations scholarship which favored the latter's emphasis on rationality rather than human nature as cause for political conflict. Panzer Division Clausewitz: Panzer-Division \"Clausewitz\" was a German panzer division during World War II, named for Carl von Clausewitz. Absolute war: The concept of absolute war was a theoretical construct developed by the Prussian military theorist General Carl von Clausewitz in his famous but unfinished philosophical exploration of war, \"Vom Kriege\" (in English, \"On War\", 1832).  It is discussed only in the first half of Book VIII (there are only a couple of references to it elsewhere) and it does not appear in sections of the text written later.  This indicates that it was an experiment that failed and was meant to be dropped. War from the Ground Up: War from the Ground Up: Twenty-First Century Combat as Politics is a 2012 book on war and military strategy written by Emile Simpson, a former British Army officer.  The book analyzes the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present) in terms of Carl von Clausewitz's theory of war, arguing that modern counter-insurgencies have more in common with domestic political struggles than the traditional state-on-state conflicts described by Clausewitz.  The book was favorably reviewed by Michael Howard, a prominent military historian, among others. Battle of Wavre: The Battle of Wavre was the final major military action of the Hundred Days campaign and the Napoleonic Wars.  It was fought on 18\u201319 June 1815 between the Prussian rearguard, consisting of the Prussian III Corps under the command of General Johann von Thielmann (whose chief-of-staff was Carl von Clausewitz) and three corps of the French army under the command of Marshal Grouchy.  A blocking action, this battle kept 33,000 French soldiers from reaching the Battle of Waterloo and so helping in the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. Christopher Bassford: Christopher Bassford (born 1953) is an American military historian, best known for his works on the Prussian military philosopher Carl von Clausewitz.  Bassford graduated from the College of William and Mary with a degree in history and honors for his dissertation on tactical nuclear weapons and completed his MA in American diplomatic history at Ohio University.  Subsequent to receiving his MA, he served five years on active duty as a U.S. Army field artillery officer, with tours in Korea and Germany.  He completed a Ph.D. in modern European history at Purdue University and became director of studies in the theory and nature of war at the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Command and Staff College, then associate professor of National Policy Issues at the U.S. Army War College.  He was Professor of Strategy at the National War College (NWC), in Washington, D.C., from 1999 until 2012, when he joined the faculty of the College of International Security Affairs (CISA) as part of the JSOMA program supporting U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).  He is the webeditor of The Clausewitz Homepage, a large educational website that has been on-line since 1995. August Otto R\u00fchle von Lilienstern: August Otto R\u00fchle von Lilienstern, born 1780, died 1847.  Prussian officer, joined Scharnhorst's Academy for Officers in the same class as Carl von Clausewitz.  Later, they both taught at the Prussian General War School, which would become the Prussian War Academy, and R\u00fchle became Clausewitz' second successor as its director.  R\u00fchle published many articles, kept official war diaries, and wrote a two-volume \"Manual for the Officer for Education in Peace and for Use in Action\" (\"Handbuch f\u00fcr den Offizier zur Belehrung im Frieden und zum Gebrauch im Felde\"), published in Berlin in 1817 and 1818.  Lilienstern and Clausewitz, teaching at the same school at the time of publication of this manual, were in agreement on many points.  For example, they agreed that war was political in nature (which was neither a novel nor a controversial idea) and that war was a \"Zweikampf.\"  (That is, literally a \"two-struggle,\" usually translated into English as \"duel,\" though in fact the imagery and metaphor that Clausewitz pursued was a wrestling match.)  Clausewitz made these ideas famous in his book On War.  Their common views on such issues can be traced to the nature of the military intellectual community in Prussia and the common influence of Scharnhorst. Carl von Clausewitz: Carl Philipp Gottfried (or Gottlieb) von Clausewitz ( ; 1 June 1780 \u2013 16 November 1831) was a Prussian general and military theorist who stressed the \"moral\" (meaning, in modern terms, psychological) and political aspects of war.  His most notable work, \"Vom Kriege\" (\"On War\"), was unfinished at his death. On War: Vom Kriege (] ) is a book on war and military strategy by Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831), written mostly after the Napoleonic wars, between 1816 and 1830, and published posthumously by his wife Marie von Br\u00fchl in 1832.  It has been translated into English several times as On War.  \"On War\" is actually an unfinished work; Clausewitz had set about revising his accumulated manuscripts in 1827, but did not live to finish the task.  His wife edited his collected works and published them between 1832 and 1835.  His 10-volume collected works contain most of his larger historical and theoretical writings, though not his shorter articles and papers or his extensive correspondence with important political, military, intellectual and cultural leaders in the Prussian state.  \"On War\" is formed by the first three volumes and represents his theoretical explorations.  It is one of the most important treatises on political-military analysis and strategy ever written, and remains both controversial and an influence on strategic thinking."

    "question": "What where both Hawker Hurricane and No. 1455 Flight apart of? Context: Supermarine Seafire: The Supermarine Seafire was a naval version of the Supermarine Spitfire adapted for operation from aircraft carriers.  In concept, it is relatively comparable to the Hawker Sea Hurricane, a navalised version of the Spitfire's stablemate, the Hawker Hurricane.  The name Seafire had been derived from the abbreviation of the longer name Sea Spitfire. Flying Legend Hawker Hurricane Replica: The Flying Legend Hawker Hurricane Replica is an Italian light-sport aircraft, designed and produced by Flying Legend of Caltagirone and introduced at the AERO Friedrichshafen show in 2011.  The aircraft, a 72% scale replica of the British Hawker Hurricane Second World War fighter, is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft. Hawker Typhoon: The Hawker Typhoon (Tiffy in RAF slang), is a British single-seat fighter-bomber, produced by Hawker Aircraft.  It was intended to be a medium\u2013high altitude interceptor, as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement. Hawker Hurricane in Yugoslav service: The Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) operated the British Hawker Hurricane Mk I fighter aircraft from 1938 to 1941.  Between 1938 and 1940, the VVKJ obtained 24 Hurricane Mk I's from early production batches, marking the first foreign sale of the aircraft.  Twenty additional aircraft were built by Zmaj under licence in Yugoslavia.  When the country was drawn into World War II by the German-led Axis invasion of April 1941, a total of 41 Hurricane Mk I's were in service as fighters.  They achieved some successes against \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft, but all Yugoslav Hurricanes were destroyed or captured during the 11-day invasion. No. 1300 Flight RAF: No. 1300 (Meteorological) Flight was formed on 31 July 1943 at RAF Alipore, West Bengal, British India, by re-designating No. 1 Meteorological Flight RAF.  The flight, strength of which had been reduced to three Hawker Hurricane Mk.IIs by this time, was disbanded on 30 May 1946 at RAF Kallang, Malaya, as No. 1300 (Meteorological THUM) Flight, THUM standing for Temperature and Humidity. No. 1455 Flight RAF: No. 1455 (Fighter) Flight was formed at RAF Tangmere, West Sussex on 7 July 1941, equipped with Turbinlite Douglas Boston and Douglas Havoc aircraft.  On operations they co-operated with the Hawker Hurricanes of 1 Squadron and 3 Squadron.  The flight was replaced with 534 Squadron on 2 September 1942. Hawker Tornado: The Hawker Tornado was a British single-seat fighter aircraft design of World War II for the Royal Air Force as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane.  The planned production of Tornados was cancelled after the engine it was designed to use\u2014the Rolls-Royce Vulture\u2014proved unreliable in service.  A parallel airframe with the Napier Sabre continued into production as the Hawker Typhoon. Sindlinger Hawker Hurricane: The Sindlinger HH-1 Hawker Hurricane is a \u215d scale homebuilt design based on the Hawker Hurricane.  Designed by Fred Sindlinger for amateur construction, the prototype was built between 1969 and 1972. Hawker Hurricane: The Hawker Hurricane is a British single-seat fighter aircraft of the 1930s\u20131940s that was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd for the Royal Air Force (RAF).  Although overshadowed by the Supermarine Spitfire, the aircraft became renowned during the Battle of Britain, accounting for 60 percent of the RAF air victories in the battle, and served in all the major theatres of the Second World War. Battle of Britain Memorial Flight: The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) is a Royal Air Force flight which provides an aerial display group usually comprising an Avro Lancaster, a Supermarine Spitfire and a Hawker Hurricane.  The aircraft are regularly seen at events commemorating the Second World War and upon British State occasions, notably Trooping the Colour, celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday in 2006, as well as the wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine Middleton in 2011 and at air displays throughout the United Kingdom and Europe."

They changed the name when Staffan William-Olsson and Fredrik Carl Stormer joined the band.  St\u00f8rmer was replaced by Torstein Ellingsen in 1995, and Ellingsen again by B\u00f8rre Dalhaug in 1998.  Due to the sudden death of the band's saxophonist Sigurd K\u00f8hn in December 2004 The Real Thing was hibernating until a reunion in 2010. Turkish people: Turkish people (Turkish: \"T\u00fcrk ulusu\" ), or the Turks (Turkish: \"T\u00fcrkler\" ), also known as Anatolian Turks (Turkish: \"Anadolu T\u00fcrkleri\" ), are a Turkic ethnic group and nation living mainly in Turkey and speaking Turkish, the most widely spoken Turkic language.  They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the speakers of Turkic languages.  Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire.  In addition, a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration, particularly in Western Europe. Fezara people: Fezara is an ethnic group of Sudan, who emigrated from Arabia to Egypt, and then to Sudan.  The number of persons in this ethnic group is about 200,000.  Most members of this ethnic group are Muslims.  This ethnic group speaks Sudanese Arabic. Unrecognized ethnic groups in China: Several ethnic groups of the People's Republic of China are not officially recognized.  Taken together, these groups (\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u6c11\u65cf \"w\u00e8i sh\u00edbi\u00e9 m\u00ednz\u00fa)\" number more than 730,000 people; if considered as a single group, they would constitute the twentieth most populous ethnic group of China.  Some scholars have estimated that there are over 200 distinct ethnic groups that inhabit China.  There are in addition small distinct ethnic groups that have been classified as part of larger ethnic groups that are officially recognized.  Some groups like the Hui of Xinjiang with the Hui of Fujian are geographically and culturally separate except for the shared belief of Islam.  Han Chinese being the world's largest ethnic group has a large diversity within it, such as in Gansu, the Han here may have genetic traits from the assimilated Tangut civilization.  Although they are indigenous to Hainan island and do not speak a Chinese language, the Limgao (Ong-Be) people near the capital (8% of the population) are counted as Han Chinese. Azerbaijanis: Azerbaijanis ( ) or Azeris (Azerbaijani: \"Az\u0259rbaycanl\u0131lar\" \u0622\u0630\u0631\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u0631, \"Az\u0259ril\u0259r\" \u0622\u0630\u0631\u06cc\u0644\u0631), also known as Azerbaijani Turks (Azerbaijani: \"Az\u0259rbaycan t\u00fcrkl\u0259ri\" \u0622\u0630\u0631\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u0631\u06a9\u0644\u0631\u06cc), are a Turkic ethnic group living mainly in Iranian Azerbaijan and the independent Republic of Azerbaijan.  They are the second-most numerous ethnic group among the Turkic peoples after Anatolian Turks.  They are predominantly Shi'i Muslims, and have a mixed cultural heritage, including Turkic, Iranian, and Caucasian elements.  They comprise the largest ethnic group in Republic of Azerbaijan and by far the second-largest ethnic group in neighboring Iran.  The world's largest number of ethnic Azerbaijanis live in Iran, followed by Azerbaijan. Norwegians: Norwegians (Norwegian: \"nordmenn\" ) are a Germanic ethnic group native to Norway.  They share a common culture and speak the Norwegian language.  Norwegian people and their descendants are found in migrant communities worldwide, notably in the United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, United Kingdom and South Africa. Oku people (Sierra Leone): The Oku people, also commonly known as Oku Mohammedans or \"Aku Mohammedans\"in Sierra Leone and as the \"Aku Marabou\" or \"Oku Marabou\" in the Gambia, are an ethnic group in Sierra Leone and the Gambia.  The Oku people are the descendants of liberated Africans of Yoruba descent from Southwest Nigeria who were liberated or came to Sierra Leone as settlers in the mid 19th century and formed a distinctive ethnic group The Oku are virtually all Muslims and are known for their conservative muslim population.  The British colonial government provided official recognition to the Oku Mohammedan community as a distinctive community in Sierra Leone.  Although the Sierra Leone government officially considered the Oku people as members of the Creole ethnic group, many Sierra Leoneans consider the Oku people as a distinctive ethnic group. Konkomba people: The Konkomba people are a Gur ethnic group residing mainly in the Northern, Brong Ahafo, Volta, Eastern and Greater Accra Regions of Ghana.  Saboba, Chereponi and Nanumba Districts, Gushiegu and Karaga districts, Zabzugu and Tatale-Sanguli districts in the Northern Region and the Nkwanta North and South Districts in the Volta Region are a few examples of administrative districts where Bikpakpaam are seen in huge populations.  Other key towns of Bikpakpaam in Ghana are Atebubu, Kintampo, Techiman and Yeji in the Brong Ahafo Region.  According to the Act 280 of the Anatomy act of Ghana, the Konkomba people (known as Bikpakpaam) are the second largest ethnic group in the Northern Region of Ghana.  The 2010 census data indicates that Bikpakpaam in Ghana number 823,000 and applying the intercensal growth rate would give a population of more than one million now.  CIA The World Factbook reports in Demographics of Ghana that Konkomba people are the 8th largest Ethnic group in Ghana representing 3.5% of the Total population of Ghana.  Saboba (Chabob) in the Northern Region of Ghana is the capital town of all Bikpakpaam in Ghana.  Bikpakpaam are also found in the republic of Togo, a sister West African country to Ghana.  In Togo Bikpakpaam reside mainly in the Kara, Central and Plateaux Regions.  Guerin Kouka (a.k.a. Nanguem Do, the capital of Dankpen district) in the Kara Region is the capital town of Bikpakpaam in Togo.  Dankpen district is located in the north western corridor of Togo.  In Schwartz's (2005) account, Bikpakpaam number about 50,100 in Togo.  The 2011 census in Togo indicates however that the total population of Bikpakpaam in Dankpen district alone was 122,209.  Visit Konkomba language for more information.  Konkomba people speak Konkomba language a.k.a Likpakpaln.  The traditional dance of Konkomba people is Kinachun\u014b (pronounced k-i-naa-chung).  All Konkomba settlements are led by a traditional chief called Ubor.  In Bikpakpaam dominant areas, the people have instituted or established their own chieftains who serve as overlords of the settlements.  For instance, the Saboba area has the Uchabob-bor as the overlord.  Bikpakpaam strongly believe in solidarity, determination and hard-work.  Until the turn of the 21st century, their primary occupation was farming and animal husbandry.  In occupational terms, Bikpakpaam are mainly subsistence farmers and rearers of animals such as poultry, small ruminants and cattle.  This, probably, explains their scattered settlement across the West African sub-region.  Indeed, Maasole intimates that Bikpakpaam have always been on the move, in search for fertile farmlands.  Most Konkombas are actively in education today and a recent research projects that Konkombas will become a dominant force in politics, health, education and the civil society by 2025. Ewe people: The Ewe people (Ewe: \"E\u028beaw\u00f3\" , lit.  \"Ewe people\"; or \" E\u028beduk\u0254\u0301 \", lit.  \"Ewe nation\",\"E\u028benyigba\" Eweland;) are an African ethnic group.

    "question": "From March 631 to April 631, Farrukhzad Khosrau V was the king of an empire that succeeded which empire? Context: Duchy of Thuringia: The Duchy of Thuringia was an eastern frontier march of the Merovingian kingdom of Austrasia, established about 631 by King Dagobert I after his troops had been defeated by the forces of the Slavic confederation of Samo at the Battle of Wogastisburg.  It was recreated in the Carolingian Empire and its dukes appointed by the king until it was absorbed by the Saxon dukes in 908.  From about 1111/12 the territory was ruled by the Landgraves of Thuringia as Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Khosrow IV: Khosrow IV was a Sasanian usurper who ruled briefly in 631.  Little is known about his rule, he appears to have ruled during a time of upheaval and chaos across the Sasanian Empire the 7th century has the century where Iran has plunged into its \"dark ages\".  He was the son of Mah-Adhur Gushnasp, who was the minister of the Sasanian Empire during the reign of Ardashir III, and Kahar-dukht, the daughter of Yazdandar, who was the son of Khosrau I.  His rule seems to coincide with other pretenders such as Hormizd VI so it is likely that he ruled a district or province rather than the Empire in its entirety.  He was killed after a few days of reign. Farrukhzad Khosrow V: Farrukhzad Khosrau V was briefly king of the Sasanian Empire from March 631 to April 631.  He was the son of Khosrau II. Samo: Samo founded the first recorded political union of Slavic tribes, known as Samo's Empire (\"realm\", \"kingdom\", or \"tribal union\"), stretching from Silesia to present-day Slovenia, ruling from 623 until his death in 658.  According to Fredegarius, the only contemporary source, Samo was a Frankish merchant who unified several Slavic tribes against robber raids and violence by nearby settled Avars, showing such bravery and command skills in battle that he was elected as the \"Slavic king\" (Latin: \"Rex Sclavorum\" ).  In 631, Samo successfully defended his realm against the Frankish Kingdom in the three-day Battle of Wogastisburg. Chach of Alor: Chach (c. 631-711 CE) (Sindhi: \u0686\u0686\u200e ) was a Brahmin who reigned as king of Sindh in the mid-7th century CE.

Two current major breweries date back to the 1920s.  The third brewery established in Korea, Jinro Coors Brewery, was founded in the 1990s.  It was later acquired by Oriental Breweries (OB).  Hite Breweries's former name was Chosun Breweries, which was established in 1933.  The company changed their name to Hite Breweries in 1998.

Ohlthaver & List Group of Companies are still the majority shareholder. List of breweries in California: This list of breweries in California, both current and defunct, includes both microbreweries and larger industrial scale breweries.  Brewing companies range widely in the volume and variety of beer produced, ranging from small breweries to massive multinational conglomerates.  Since 1983, California has allowed breweries to sell beer on their premises, giving rise to numerous brewpubs and microbreweries. Brouwerij 't IJ: Brouwerij 't IJ (] ; English: The IJ Brewery) is a small brewery in Amsterdam, Netherlands.  It is located in a former bath house named \"Funen\", next to the De Gooyer windmill.  The brewery was opened by Kaspar Peterson, a former musician, in October 1985 and was one of several small breweries that opened in cities around the Netherlands in response to consumers' dissatisfaction with beer brewed by the larger companies.  It brews eight standard beers and three seasonal beers, besides limited edition beers. Microbrewery: A microbrewery or craft brewery is a brewery that produces small amounts of beer (or sometimes root beer), typically much smaller than large-scale corporate breweries, and is independently owned.  Such breweries are generally characterized by their emphasis on quality, flavour and brewing technique. List of breweries and wineries in South Dakota: This is list of breweries in South Dakota.  South Dakota is one of 14 U.S. states that forbids small breweries from directly distributing beer products.  Small breweries are required to use a distributor, per South Dakota law. Beer by region: This is a list of articles and categories dealing with beer by region, including breweries and brewing in general.  Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage, and is the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea.  It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage.  A brewery is a dedicated building for the making of beer, though beer can be made at home, and has been for much of beer's history.  A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company.  The diversity of size in breweries is matched by the diversity of processes, degrees of automation, and kinds of beer produced in breweries.  A brewery is typically divided into distinct sections, with each section reserved for one part of the brewing process. List of microbreweries: This is a list of notable microbreweries.  A microbrewery is a brewery which produces a limited amount of beer.  The qualifications to be classified as a microbrewery vary by country.  The term \"microbrewery\" originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s to describe the new generation of small breweries which focused on producing traditional cask ale.  The first successful example of this approach was Litchborough Brewery founded by Bill Urquhart in 1975 in the Northamptonshire village of the same name.  Although originally \"microbrewery\" was used in relation to the size of breweries, it gradually came to reflect an alternative attitude and approach to brewing flexibility, adaptability, experimentation, and customer service.  The term and trend spread to the United States in the 1980s, where it eventually was used as a designation of breweries that produce fewer than 15,000 U.S. beer barrels (1,800,000 liters) (475,000 U.S. gallons) annually. Stone Brewing Co.: Stone Brewing is a brewery headquartered in Escondido, California, USA.  Founded in 1996 in San Marcos, California, it is the largest brewery in Southern California.  Based on 2016 sales volume it is the ninth largest craft brewery in the United States. Beer Wars: Beer Wars is a 2009 documentary film about the American beer industry.  In particular, it covers the differences between large corporate breweries, namely Anheuser-Busch, the Miller Brewing Company, and the Coors Brewing Company opposed to smaller breweries like Dogfish Head Brewery, Moonshot 69, Yuengling, Stone Brewing Co., and other producers of craft beer.  Also covered is how advertising and lobbyists are used to control the beer market, implying that these things harm competition and consumer choice."

    "question": "In the NASA mission where Moon trees were taken into space, what was the nickname of the Command Module? Context: Apollo (spacecraft): The Apollo spacecraft was composed of three parts designed to accomplish the American Apollo program's goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by the end of the 1960s and returning them safely to Earth.  The expendable (single-use) spacecraft consisted of a combined Command/Service Module (CSM) and a Lunar Module (LM).  Two additional components complemented the spacecraft stack for space vehicle assembly: a Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) designed to shield the LM from the aerodynamic stress of launch and to connect the CSM to the Saturn launch vehicle; and a Launch Escape System (LES) to carry the crew in the Command Module safely away from the launch vehicle in the event of a launch emergency. Moon Machines: Moon Machines in the US and UK is a Science Channel HD documentary miniseries consisting of six episodes documenting the engineering challenges of the Apollo Program to land a man on the Moon.  It covers everything from the iconic Saturn V to the Command Module, the Lunar Module, the Space Suits, the Guidance and Control Computer, and the Lunar Rover.  It was created by the team who made \"In the Shadow of the Moon\" in association with NASA to commemorate the agency's fiftieth anniversary in 2008.  It first aired in June 2008 and was released on DVD a year later in June 2009. Apollo 8: Apollo 8, the second human spaceflight mission in the United States Apollo space program, was launched on December 21, 1968, and became the first crewed spacecraft to leave Earth orbit, reach the Earth's Moon, orbit it and return safely to Earth.  The three-astronaut crew \u2014 Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot James Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders \u2014 became the first humans to: travel beyond low Earth orbit; escape Earth's gravity; see Earth as a whole planet; enter the gravity well of another celestial body (Earth's moon); orbit another celestial body (Earth's moon); directly see the far side of the Moon with their own eyes; witness an Earthrise; escape the gravity of another celestial body (Earth's moon); and re-enter the gravitational well of Earth.  The 1968 mission, the third flight of the Saturn\u00a0V rocket and that rocket's first crewed launch, was also the first human spaceflight launch from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Apollo 12: Apollo 12 was the sixth manned flight in the United States Apollo program and the second to land on the Moon (an H type mission).  It was launched on November 14, 1969, from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, four months after Apollo 11.  Mission commander Charles \"Pete\" Conrad and Lunar Module Pilot Alan L. Bean performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while Command Module Pilot Richard F. Gordon remained in lunar orbit.  The landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the Ocean of Storms. Apollo 16: Apollo 16 was the tenth manned mission in the United States Apollo space program, the fifth and penultimate to land on the Moon and the first to land in the lunar highlands.  The second of the so-called \"J missions,\" it was crewed by Commander John Young, Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke and Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly.  Launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972, the mission lasted 11 days, 1 hour, and 51 minutes, and concluded at 2:45 PM EST on April 27. Moon tree: Moon trees are trees grown from 500 seeds taken into orbit around the Moon by Stuart Roosa during the Apollo 14 mission in 1971.  As the Command Module Pilot on the Apollo 14 mission, and because he was a former smoke jumper, Roosa was contacted by Ed Cliff, who was the Chief of the Forest Service at the time, and who proposed the idea of taking the seeds along.  Seeds for the experiment were chosen from five different types of trees: Loblolly Pine, Sycamore, Sweetgum, Redwood, and Douglas Fir. Stuart Roosa: Stuart Allen \"Stu\" Roosa (August 16, 1933 \u2013 December 12, 1994), (Col, USAF), was an American aeronautical engineer, United States Air Force pilot, test pilot, and NASA astronaut, who was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 14 mission.  The mission lasted from January 31 to February 9, 1971 and was the third mission to land astronauts (Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell) on the Moon.  While Shepard and Mitchell spent two days on the lunar surface, Roosa conducted experiments from orbit in the Command Module \"Kitty Hawk\".  He was one of only 24 people to travel to the Moon. AS-201: AS-201 (or SA-201), flown February 26, 1966, was the first unmanned test flight of an entire production Block I Apollo Command/Service Module and the Saturn IB launch vehicle.  The spacecraft consisted of the second Block I command module and the first Block I service module.  The suborbital flight was a partially successful demonstration of the service propulsion system and the reaction control systems of both modules, and successfully demonstrated the capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive re-entry from low Earth orbit. Lunex Project: The Lunex Project was a US Air Force 1958 plan for a manned lunar landing prior to the Apollo Program.  The final lunar expedition plan in 1961 was for a 21-airman underground Air Force base on the Moon by 1968 at a total cost of $7.5 billion.  The primary distinction between the later Apollo missions and Lunex was the orbital rendezvous maneuver.  The Lunex vehicle, composed of a landing module and a lifting body return/re-entry module, would land the entire vehicle and all astronauts on the surface, whereas the final Apollo mission involved a separate ascent module leaving the command module and service module connected in lunar orbit with a single astronaut.  The original plan for Apollo was for direct ascent, similar to Lunex. Apollo 9: Apollo 9 was the third manned mission in the United States Apollo space program and the first flight of the Command/Service Module (CSM) with the Lunar Module (LM, pronounced \"lem\").  Its three-person crew, consisting of Commander James McDivitt, Command Module Pilot David Scott, and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart, spent ten days in low Earth orbit testing several aspects critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems, and docking maneuvers.  The mission was the second manned launch of a Saturn V rocket."

    "question": "Do both Korematsu v. United States and Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire cases regard the rights of U. S. citizens? Context: Eric Yamamoto: Eric Yamamoto, the Korematsu Professor of Law and Social Justice at the University of Hawai\u02bb i at M\u0101noa William S. Richardson School of Law, is an internationally recognized expert on issues of racial justice, including racial reconciliation and redress.  Flowing from the landmark Korematsu v. United States case, he is known for his work as a member of Fred Korematsu's legal team. Korematsu v. United States: Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case concerning the constitutionality of Executive Order 9066, which ordered Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II regardless of citizenship. Ex parte Endo: Ex parte Endo, or Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (1944), was a United States Supreme Court ex parte decision handed down on December 18, 1944, in which the Justices unanimously ruled that the U.S. government could not continue to detain a citizen who was \"concededly loyal\" to the United States.  Although the Court did not touch on the constitutionality of the exclusion of people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast\u2014which they had found not to violate citizen rights in their \"Korematsu v. United States\" decision on the same date\u2014the Endo ruling nonetheless led to the reopening of the West Coast to Japanese Americans after their incarceration in camps across the U.S. interior during World War II. Duncan v. Kahanamoku: Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U.S. 304 (1946), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court.  It is often associated with the Japanese exclusion cases (\"Hirabayashi v. United States\", \"Korematsu v. United States\" and \"Ex parte Endo\") because it involved wartime curtailment of fundamental civil liberties under the aegis of military authority, though in this case neither the plaintiff nor the nominal defendant were Japanese. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire: Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court articulated the fighting words doctrine, a limitation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.

William Miller, Solicitor General of the United States Theodore Olson, and lead litigator of the \"Korematsu v. United States\" civil rights case, Dale Minami. Freedom of movement under United States law: Freedom of movement under United States law is governed primarily by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution which states, \"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\"  As far back as the circuit court ruling in \"Corfield v. Coryell,\" 6 Fed.  Cas.  546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right.  In \"Paul v. Virginia,\" 75 U.S. 168 (1869), the Court defined freedom of movement as \"right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them.\"  However, the Supreme Court did not invest the federal government with the authority to protect freedom of movement.  Under the \"privileges and immunities\" clause, this authority was given to the states, a position the Court held consistently through the years in cases such as \"Ward v. Maryland,\" 79 U.S. 418 (1871), the \"Slaughter-House Cases,\" 83 U.S. 36 (1873) and \"United States v. Harris,\" 106 U.S. 629 (1883). Stephen Halbrook: Stephen P. Halbrook is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute and an author and lawyer known for his litigation on behalf of the National Rifle Association.

He has argued and won three cases before the US Supreme Court: \"Printz v. United States\", \"United States v. Thompson-Center Arms Company\", and \"Castillo v. United States\".  He has also written briefs in many other cases, including the Supreme Court cases \"Small v. United States\" (pertaining to the Gun Control Act of 1968) and \"McDonald v. Chicago\".  In \"District of Columbia v. Heller\", he wrote a brief on behalf of the majority of both houses of Congress.  More broadly, his decades of research on the Second Amendment contributed to the intellectual foundation of the \"Heller\" decision.  He has written many books and articles on the topic of gun control, some of which have been cited in Supreme Court opinions (\"Heller\", \"McDonald\", \"Printz v. United States\").  He has testified before congress on multiple occasions.  Halbrook\u2019s most important scholarly contribution, however, was the book \"That Every Man Be Armed\", originally published in 1986.  The book was the most thorough analysis of the legal history and original intent of the Second Amendment. Dale Minami: Dale Minami (born October 13, 1946) is a San Francisco-based lawyer best known for heading the legal team that overturned the conviction of Fred Korematsu, whose defiance of the World War II Japanese American internment order lead to Korematsu v. United States, one of the most controversial United States Supreme Court decisions of the 20th century. Criminal law in the Waite Court: During the tenure of Morrison Waite as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (March 4, 1874 through March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard an unprecedented volume and frequency of criminal cases.

Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v. Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v.

The position is often likened to that of a vice president, but is significantly different even though both positions are \"number two\" offices.  The position of deputy prime minister should not be confused with the Canadian Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister of Canada, a nonpolitical civil servant position.  Also, the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada does not act as a \"number two\". Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925: The Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, that makes the sale of peerages or any other honours illegal.  It was brought in after the Coalition government of David Lloyd George was severely embarrassed by the sale of honours, for the personal financial gain of the Prime Minister.  The practice was legal and dated back several decades, Lloyd George made the practice more systematic and more brazen, charging \u00a310,000 for a knighthood, \u00a330,000 for baronetcy, and \u00a350,000 upwards for a peerage.  Prime Minister Lloyd George in mid-1922 was fast losing his political support, and his sales were denounced in the House of Lords as an abuse of the Prime Minister's powers of patronage. Letters of last resort: The letters of last resort are four identically-worded handwritten letters from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the commanding officers of the four British ballistic missile submarines.  They contain orders on what action to take in the event that an enemy nuclear strike has destroyed the British government and has killed or otherwise incapacitated both the Prime Minister and the \"second person\" (normally a high-ranking member of the Cabinet) whom the Prime Minister has designated to make a decision on how to act in the event of the Prime Minister's death.  In the event that the orders were to be carried out, the action taken could be the last official act of Her Majesty's Government. Prime Minister of Northern Ireland: The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland was the head of the Government of Northern Ireland between 1921 and 1972.  No such office was provided for in the Government of Ireland Act 1920, however the Lord Lieutenant, as with Governors-General in other Westminster Systems such as in Canada, chose to appoint someone to head the executive even though no such post existed in statute law.  The office-holder assumed the title \"Prime Minister\" to draw parallels with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  On the advice of the new Prime Minister, the Lord Lieutenant then created the \"Department of the Prime Minister\".  The office of Prime Minister of Northern Ireland was abolished in 1972, along with the contemporary government, when direct rule of Northern Ireland was transferred to London. Reindeer Act: The Reindeer Act or Reindeer Industry Act of 1937 is a United States federal law passed in 1937 by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on September 1 of that year.  The act effectively prohibited the ownership of reindeer herds in Alaska by non-Native Americans.  The act was intended to provide for Alaskan natives and to allow them to establish a self-sustaining industry.  Authority to promulgate rules regarding the ownership and maintenance of reindeer herds was delegated to the Bureau of Indian Affairs via the Secretary of the Interior, who banned most transactions to non-natives.  The act was modeled in part on Norwegian and Swedish policies on the ownership of reindeer by the Sami people of Lapland.  Many Sami had arrived in Alaska to manage the reindeer in the 1930s.  The Alaskan Sami were required to sell their herds to the government, and many left Alaska after doing so. Distribution of Industry Act 1950: The Distribution of Industry Act 1950 was an Act of Parliament passed in the United Kingdom by the Labour government of Clement Attlee.  It strengthened the powers of the Board of Trade in the Development Areas, making \u201cfurther provision for the acquisition of land, creation of easements and carrying out of work in development areas.\u201d  It also authorized \u201cthe Board of Trade \u201cto make grants, in exceptional cases in connection with the establishment in, or transfer to, development areas of industrial undertakings, and to make grants or loans to housing associations for the provision of dwellings in development areas.\u201d  In addition, the Act also provided for payments towards the cost of removal and resettlement of key workers and their dependants. Clement Attlee: Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (3 January 1883 \u2013 8 October 1967) was a British Labour politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955.  In 1940, Attlee took Labour into the wartime coalition government and served under Winston Churchill, becoming the first person to hold the office of Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  He went on to lead the Labour Party to an unexpected landslide victory at the 1945 general election; forming the first Labour majority government, and a mandate to implement its postwar reforms.  The 12.0% national swing from the Conservatives to Labour was unprecedented at that time and remains the largest ever achieved by any party at a general election in British electoral history.  He was re-elected with a narrow majority at the 1950 general election.  In the following year, Attlee called a snap general election, hoping to increase his parliamentary majority.  However, he was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives under the leadership of Winston Churchill; despite winning the most votes of any political party in any general election in British political history until the Conservative Party's fourth consecutive victory in 1992.  Attlee remains the longest-ever serving Leader of the Labour Party. Bush\u2013Aznar memo: The Bush\u2013Aznar memo is reportedly a documentation of a February 22, 2003 conversation in Crawford, Texas between US president George W. Bush, Prime Minister of Spain Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Daniel Fried, Alberto Carnero, and Javier Rup\u00e9rez, the Spanish ambassador to the U.S. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi participated by telephone.  Rup\u00e9rez transcribed the meeting's details which \"El Pa\u00eds\", a Madrid daily newspaper, published on September 26, 2007.  The conversation focuses on the efforts of the US, UK, and Spain to get a second resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council.  This \"second resolution\" would have followed Resolution 1441.  Supporters of the resolution also referred to it as the \"eighteenth resolution\" in reference to the 17 UN resolutions that Iraq had failed to comply with. Gordon Bajnai: Gy\u00f6rgy Gordon Bajnai (] ; born 5 March 1968) is a Hungarian entrepreneur and economist, who served as the seventh Prime Minister of Hungary from 2009 to 2010.  In March 2009, following Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny's announced resignation, Bajnai was nominated by the ruling Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) to become Hungary's next prime minister.  Bajnai became prime minister when the parliament passed a constructive motion of no-confidence against Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny on 14 April 2009. Industry Act 1975: The Industry Act 1975 (c. 68) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed by Harold Wilson's Labour government."

    "question": "What Cantonese slang term can mean both \"ghost man\" and to refer to Westerners? Context: Gweilo: Gweilo or gwailou (, pronounced ] ) is a common Cantonese slang term for Westerners.  In its unmodified form, it applies only to European ethnicities and has a history of racially deprecatory use.  Cantonese speakers frequently use \"gwailou\" to refer to Westerners in general use, in a non-derogatory context, although whether this type of usage is offensive is disputed by both Cantonese and Westerners alike. Sheng nu: Sheng nu (\u5269\u5973; sh\u00e8ngn\u01da; common translation: \"leftover women\" or \"leftover ladies\") is a derogatory term made popular by the All-China Women's Federation that classifies women who remain unmarried in their late twenties and beyond.  The term is most prominently used in China, including a state sponsored directive and program, but has been used to describe women across Asia, India, and North America.  The term has gone on to become widely used in the mainstream media and has been the subject of several televisions series, magazine and newspaper articles, and book publications focusing on both the good and bad aspects of the term and surrounding culture.  Xu Xiaomin of \"The China Daily\" described the sheng nus as \"a social force to be reckoned with\" while others have argued the term should be taken as a positive to mean \"successful women\".  The slang term, 3S or 3S Women, meaning \"single, seventies (1970s), and stuck\" has also been used in place of sheng nu.  The equivalent term for men, \"guang gun\" (\u5149\u68cd) meaning bare branches, is used to refer to men who do not marry and thus do not add 'branches' to the family tree.  Similarly, \"shengnan\" (\u5269\u7537) or \"leftover men\" has also been used. Ghosts (2006 film): Ghosts is a 2006 drama film directed by Nick Broomfield, based on the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster.  The title is a reference to the Cantonese slang term \"Gweilo\" (\u9b3c\u4f6c), meaning \"ghost man\", used for white people. Dongo: Dongo may refer to: The mix between a dingo and any other dog is referred to as a \"Dongo\" and also is a slang term for male genitalia.  Dongo is also reported to be, but is not widely used, as a slang term in Australia as a substitute for the color orange. Ducking (slang): \"Ducking\" is a prison slang term for a technique through which prisoners modify the behavior of correctional officers and other prison staff members using manipulation and coercion.  The prison slang term for a prison staff member that has been manipulated is a \"duck\". Zips: Zips (also Siggies or Geeps) is a slang term often used as a derogatory slur by Italian American and Sicilian American mobsters in reference to newer immigrant Sicilian and Italian mafiosi.  The name is said to have originated from mobsters' inability to understand the faster-speaking Sicilian dialects, which appeared to \"zip\" by.  Other theories include pejorative uses such as Sicilians' preference for silent, homemade zip guns.  According to still another theory, the term is a contraction of the Sicilian slang term for \"hicks\" or \"primitives.\"  The older Sicilian mafiosi of pre-Prohibition known as \"Mustache Petes\" (who eventually were deposed by American-born mobsters during the Castellammarese War) were also referred to as zips. Cantonese slang: Cantonese slang is a type of slang used in areas where Cantonese language is spoken. Beard (companion): Beard is a slang term describing a person who is used, knowingly or unknowingly, as a date, romantic partner (boyfriend or girlfriend), or spouse either to conceal infidelity or to conceal one's sexual orientation.  The American slang term originally referred to anyone who acted on behalf of another, in any transaction, to conceal a person's true identity.  The term can be used in heterosexual and homosexual contexts, but is especially used within LGBT culture.  References to beards are seen in mainstream television and films, and other entertainment. Shiv (weapon): Shiv (possibly from the Romani word \"chivomengro\", \"knife\"), also \"chiv\", is a slang term for any sharp or pointed implement used as a knife-like weapon.  The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" suggests \"shive\", a razor, documented in 1915, as the root word.  In the 1920s, \"shiv\" was also a common slang term for a bladed weapon, mostly a knife.  In the United States, an improvised prison knife is also often called a shank. Shmohawk: Shmohawk or schmohawk is a slang term that might have derived from \"schmo\", a slang term meaning \"fool\".  The HBO television show \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" gave the word recent notoriety, and HBO even sells a \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" schmohawk mug.  Earlier uses of the word can be found in the \"Crusader Rabbit\" animated cartoon \"Crusader and the Schmohawk Indians\", released in 1950 and in Saul Bellow's 1958 novel \"Henderson the Rain King\"."

This magnificent monastery is also known as Maha Waiyan Bontha Bagaya Monastery.  During King Hsinbyushin's reign (1763\u20131776), Maha Thiri Zeya Thinkhaya, town officer of Magwe built the monastery in the Bagaya monastic establishment and dedicated to Shin Dhammabhinanda.  It is one of the famous tourists attractions in Burma. Buddhism in Hong Kong: Buddhism is a major religion in Hong Kong and has been greatly influential in the traditional culture of its populace.  Among the most prominent Buddhist temples in the city there are the Chi Lin Nunnery in Diamond Hill, built in the Tang Dynasty's architectural style; the Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island, famous for the outdoor bronze statue, Tian Tan Buddha, which attracts a large number of visitors during the weekends and holidays.

It is located on the southeastern foot of the Mount at an elevation of 160 metres.  The founding of the monastery in AD 963 by Athanasius the Athonite marks the beginning of the organized monastic life at Mount Athos.  At the location of the monastery, there was one of the ancient cities of the Athos peninsula, perhaps Akrothooi, from which the sarcophagi of the monastery that are in the oil storage house come.  The history of the monastery is the most complete compared to the history of the other monasteries, because its historical archives were preserved almost intact.  It is possible that the study of these archives may contribute to the completion of the knowledge of the history of other monasteries, whose archives were partially or completely lost.

Enchey Monastery: The Enchey Monastery was established in 1909 above Gangtok, the capital city of Sikkim in the Northeastern Indian state.  It belongs to the Nyingma order of Vajrayana Buddhism.  The monastery built around the then small hamlet of Gangtok became a religious centre.  The location was blessed by Lama Drupthob Karpo, a renowned exponent of tantric (adept) art in Buddhism with flying powers; initially a small Gompa was established by him after he flew from Maenam Hill in South Sikkim to this site.  The literal meaning of Enchey Monastery is the \"Solitary Monastery\".  Its sacredness is attributed to the belief that Khangchendzonga and Yabdean \u2013 the protecting deities \u2013 reside in this monastery.  As, according to a legend, Guru Padmasambhava had subdued the spirits of the Khangchendzonga, Yabdean and Mah\u0101k\u0101la here.  In view of this legend, the religious significance of Enchey Monastery is deeply ingrained in every household in Gangtok.

    "question": "Are Phlebodium and Pieris both species of ferns? Context: Sinopieris: Sinopieris is a genus of butterflies in the family Pieridae.  The genus occurs in Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan, Gansu, Shaanxi and Sichuan.  All six species were originally included in \"Pieris\".  The two genera are distinguished by the venation in the apical area of the forewing.  Most \"Sinopieris\" species have a suffused grey or blackish post-discal band whereas \"Pieris\" usually have a single (males) or a pair (females) of blackish post-discal spots on the forewings, and no trace of any spot or band on the hindwings. Stephanitis takeyai: The andromeda lace bug (Stephanitis takeyai) is a pest insect on plants of the genus \"Pieris\", especially \"Pieris japonica\", the Japanese andromeda.  It originated in Japan with its host plant but has since been introduced to other areas of the globe.  At least one \"Pieris\" species, \"Pieris floribunda\", is resistant to the bug. Pieris (plant): Pieris ( or ) is a genus of seven species of shrubs in the family Ericaceae, native to mountain regions of eastern and southern Asia, eastern North America and Cuba.  Known commonly in North America as andromedas or fetterbushes, they are broad-leaved evergreen shrubs growing to 1 - tall and 3 - wide.  The leaves are spirally arranged, often appearing to be in whorls at the end of each shoot with bare stretches of shoot below; they are lanceolate-ovate, 2 - long and 1.0 - broad, leathery textured, and with an entire or serrated margin.  The young leaves in spring are typically brightly coloured.  The flowers are bell-shaped, 5 - long, white or pink, and arranged in racemes 5 - long.  The fruit is a woody capsule which splits into five sections to release the numerous small seeds. Leptosporangiate fern: Leptosporangiate ferns are the largest group of living ferns, including some 11000 species worldwide.  They constitute the subclass Polypodiidae, but are often considered to be the class Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida, although other classifications assign them a different rank.  The leptosporangiate ferns are one of the four major groups of ferns, with the other three being the Eusporangiate ferns comprising the marattioid ferns (Marattiidae, Marattiaceae), the horsetails (Equisetiidae, Equisetaceae), and whisk ferns and moonworts. Phlebodium: Phlebodium is a small genus of two to four species of ferns, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.  The genus is closely related to \"Polypodium\", and the species were formerly included in that genus. Pieris floribunda: Pieris floribunda is a North American species of broadleaf evergreen shrub, a member of the fetterbush genus in the blueberry family (Ericaceae).  It is commonly known in North America as mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda.  All parts of \"Pieris floribunda\" are poisonous if ingested.  It is a rare plant to find in landscapes because it is difficult to propagate and it often does not adapt well to cultivation.  However, there are a few specialty and native plant nurseries that sell some, overcoming the more difficult propagation.  In landscapes it should be grown in full to part shade, out of windy locations, and have a good quality soil with lots of organic matter that is acid of pH 4.5 to 6.5 Pieris (butterfly): Pieris, the whites or garden whites, is a widespread now almost cosmopolitan genus of butterflies of the family Pieridae.  The highest species diversity is in the Palearctic.  Many species of this genus have caterpillars which feed on cabbage and other members of the Brassicaceae.  The chemical basis of this association with a certain plant group has been studied for over 100 years, and is now known to occur via a number of biochemical adaptations to chemicals called glucosinolates in these plants.  In contrast to most other insects, \"Pieris\" caterpillars are able to detoxify these chemicals, and have become so specialised that they will not eat any food without glucosinolates.  The \"Pieris\" females, in turn, check for the presence of glucosinolates before laying eggs on a plant.  The crop-damaging species have spread from Eurasia to most of the rest of the world (most recently to South America and Africa) and are considered pest insects almost everywhere.  There are species of \"Pieris\" that are not pests, such as the North American species \"Pieris oleracea\" and \"Pieris virginiensis\".  These butterflies feed successfully only on specific native vegetation. Pieris canidia: Pieris canidia, the Indian cabbage white, is a butterfly in the family Pieridae. \" Pieris rapae\" is one of the closest species in the Pieridae family. Phlebodium aureum: Phlebodium aureum (golden polypody, golden serpent fern, cabbage palm fern, gold-foot fern, hare-foot fern; syn.  \"Polypodium aureum\", \"Polypodium leucatomos\") is an epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.  It is confined to the eastern side of the continents, extending north into the United States to Florida and the extreme southeast of Georgia, and south through the Caribbean (the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Lesser Antilles), and northern and eastern South America to Paraguay.  It is the only species of \"Phlebodium\" found in North America, the other species all confined to South America.  Other common names include calaguala (Spanish language), laua`e haole (Hawaiian), samambaia (Portuguese), and hartassbr\u00e4ken (Swedish). Tree fern: The tree ferns are the ferns that grow with a trunk elevating the fronds above ground level.  Most tree ferns are members of the \"core tree ferns\", belonging to the families Dicksoniaceae, Metaxyaceae, and Cibotiaceae in the order Cyatheales.  In addition to those families, many ferns in other groups may be considered tree ferns, such as several ferns in the family Osmundaceae, which can achieve short trunks under a metre tall, and particularly ferns in the genus \"Cibotium\", which can grow ten metres tall.  Fern species with short trunks in the genera \"Blechnum, Calochleana, Cnemedaria, Culcita\" (Europe's only tree fern), \"Cystodium, Leptopteris, Lophosoria, Sadleria, Thyrsopteris\" and \"Todea\" could also be considered tree ferns in a liberal interpretation of the term."

The name Fakhroh came from their great grandfather Fakher whose son of Tamim bin Mor bin Ad bin Muder bin Adnan which is considered as a very ancient Arab tribe dwelled by people from the midst of the Arabian Peninsula. Franklin Seaver Pratt: Franklin Seaver Pratt (November 1, 1829 \u2013 January 11, 1894), also known as Franklyn or Frank S.

He married Elizabeth Keka\u02bbaniau La\u02bbanui, a member of the Hawaiian nobility, and defended her claims to the Hawaiian crown lands during the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Prachethasa: Prachetasa is considered to be one of the most mysterious figures of Hindu mythology.  It is an epithet for Varuna the god of water and its principle and as such are related to \u2018shatabhoisag\u2019 asterism.  According to the puranas Prachetasa was one of the 10 Prajapatis who were ancient sages and law gives.  But there is also a reference to 10 Prachetas who were sons of Prachinabarthis and great grandsons of Prithu.  It is said that they lived for 10,000 years in a great ocean, very deeply engaged in meditation upon Vishnu and obtained from Him the boon of becoming the progenitors of mankind.  They married a girl named Manisha, a daughter of Kanclu .  Daksha was their son.  But according to another version it is said that Prajapathi Daksha an ancient sage and contemporary of Lord Shiva, gave his 27 daughters in marriage to Soma ( Chandra).  Soma was born from Marichi.  But it is also said that Daksha was also the son of a woman called Marichi.  Marichi is again referred to as the mother of Daksha.  Thus it appears that Prachetasas were Daksha\u2019s fathers as well as Daksha\u2019s great grandsons.  This confusion arises in Hindu families essentially because children are often named after their grandfather or great grandfather.

A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of registration of the birth and which then appears on a birth certificate (see \"birth name\"), but may change subsequently.  Most jurisdictions require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a name change to be recorded at marriage.  The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order).  The term is also used when an individual changes his/her first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations). List of Braathens destinations: Braathens (until 1998 known as Braathens SAFE) was a Norwegian scheduled and charter airline that operated from 1946 to 2004.

    "question": "What is the ratio of flow velocity past a boundary to the local speed of sound for a Saab JAS 39 Gripen? Context: Link-ZA: Link-ZA (also \"Link ZA\" or \"LinkZA\") is a tactical data link system used by the South African National Defence Force.  It is the data communication component of the \"Combat Net Interoperability Standard\" (CNIS).  Development began in the early 1990s when South Africa acquired a wide variety of high technology defence equipment such as Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter jets, BAE Hawk lead-in fighter trainers, Valour-class frigates and other weapons systems.  Because South Africa was not able to acquire the NATO standard Link-16 system an indigenous system was developed. Saab 38: The Saab 38 (also known as B3LA or A 38/Sk 38) was a single-engine jet trainer and attack aircraft planned by Saab during the 1970s.  The project was a collaboration between Saab and the Italian aircraft manufacturer Aermacchi.  It was to replace the older Saab 105 jet trainer in the Swedish Air Force, but the aircraft never got past the drawing board and was canceled in 1979 in favour of the more advanced Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter. Pitot tube: A Pitot ( ) tube, also known as Pitot probe, is a pressure measurement instrument used to measure fluid flow velocity.  The pitot tube was invented by the French engineer Henri Pitot in the early 18th century and was modified to its modern form in the mid-19th century by French scientist Henry Darcy.  It is widely used to determine the airspeed of an aircraft, water speed of a boat, and to measure liquid, air and gas flow velocities in certain industrial applications.  The pitot tube is used to measure the local flow velocity at a given point in the flow stream and not the average flow velocity in the pipe or conduit. Industrigruppen JAS: Industrigruppen JAS (IG JAS) was a Swedish industrial consortium under executive director Harald Schr\u00f6der founded in August 1980 by Saab-Scania (later Saab), Volvo Flygmotor, LM Ericsson, Svenska Radioaktiebolaget Communications and F\u00f6renade Fabriksverken (FFV) for the development, construction and manufacturing of the new Swedish combat aircraft JAS 39 Gripen on behalf of the Swedish Airforce. The tender was submitted in June 1981 to F\u00f6rsvarets Materielverk (FMV), and on 30 June 1982 a contract was signed for development, and for five prototype aircraft and 30 production aircraft. Saab JAS 39 Gripen: The Saab JAS 39 Gripen (English: \"griffin\" ) is a light single-engine multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by the Swedish aerospace company Saab.  It was designed to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force (\"Flygvapnet\").  The Gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly-by-wire flight controls.  It is powered by the Volvo RM12, and has a top speed of Mach 2.  Later aircraft are modified for NATO interoperability standards and to undertake in-flight refuelling. A-Darter: The V3E A-Darter (Agile Darter) is a modern short-range infrared homing (\"heat seeking\") air-to-air missile, featuring countermeasures resistance with a 180-degree look angle and 120-degrees per second track rate, developed by South Africa's Denel Dynamics (formerly Kentron) and Brazil's Mectron, Avibras and Opto Eletr\u00f4nica.  It will equip South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen C/D and BAe Hawk 120; Brazilian Air Force's A-1M AMX, Northrop F-5BR and Gripen E/F.  It is expected to be in production before the end of 2015. Volvo RM12: The Volvo RM12 is a low-bypass afterburning turbofan jet engine developed for the Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter.  A version of the General Electric F404, the RM12 was produced by Volvo Aero (now GKN Aerospace Engine Systems). PS-05/A: The PS-05/A is a pulse-doppler radar currently used by the JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft (JAS 39A, B, C and D variants).  It weighs 156\u00a0kg and was developed by Ericsson in collaboration with GEC-Marconi, sharing some technology with the latter's Blue Vixen radar for the Sea Harrier (which inspired the Eurofighter's CAPTOR radar). Bombkapsel 90: Bombkapsel 90 (BK90) is the Swedish Air Force's nomenclature for a gliding stand-off submunitions dispenser, or cluster bomb, with 72 submunitions.  It is manufactured by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace in Germany by the name of DWS 24 - \"Dispenser Weapon System 24 barrels\".  The BK90 is also commonly known as DWS 39 \"Mj\u00f6lner\" because it was intended for use with the Saab JAS 39 Gripen.  In the future it could be also integrated on the Eurofighter Typhoon.  Its design is very similar to that of the American AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon. Mach number: In fluid dynamics, the Mach number (M or Ma) ( ; ] ) is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of flow velocity past a boundary to the local speed of sound."

    "question": "Which player, who also played for the New Jersey Nets and the Golden State Warriors, finished third in the league with 231 three-point field goals during the 1995-96 Atlanta Hawks season? Context: Mookie Blaylock: Daron Oshay \"Mookie\" Blaylock (born March 20, 1967) is an American retired professional basketball player.  He spent 13 years in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with three different teams, namely the New Jersey Nets, Atlanta Hawks, and the Golden State Warriors. George T. Johnson: George Thomas Johnson (born December 18, 1948) is an American retired professional basketball player.  A 6'11\" forward/center born in Tylertown, Mississippi and from Dillard University, he played in 13 NBA seasons (1972\u20131983; 1984\u20131986) as a member of the Golden State Warriors, the Buffalo Braves, the New Jersey Nets, the San Antonio Spurs, the Atlanta Hawks, and the Seattle SuperSonics. Garry St. Jean: Garry St. Jean (born February 10, 1950 in Chicopee, Massachusetts) is an American former professional basketball coach and executive.  St. Jean was head coach of the Sacramento Kings from 1992 through 1997.  He later became the general manager of the Golden State Warriors, and in 1999\u20132000 he doubled as a head coach after P.J. Carlesimo was fired.  St. Jean was a pro scout for the New Jersey Nets in the 2010\u201311 season.  He has been an in-studio analyst for Golden State Warriors coverage on Comcast SportsNet Bay Area since the start of the 2011-2012 season. 1995\u201396 Atlanta Hawks season: The 1995\u201396 NBA season was the Hawks' 47th season in the National Basketball Association, and 28th season in Atlanta.  During the offseason, the Hawks re-acquired Spud Webb from the Sacramento Kings.  The Hawks played above .500 during the first month of the season, but then struggled losing 10 of their 14 games in December before posting a ten-game winning streak in January.  At midseason, Webb was traded along with Andrew Lang to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Christian Laettner and Sean Rooks.  The Hawks finished fourth in the Central Division with a 46\u201336 record.  Head coach Lenny Wilkens reached a significant milestone, becoming the first NBA coach to reach 1,000 victories.  Steve Smith led the Hawks in scoring averaging 18.1 points per game, and Mookie Blaylock finished third in the league with 231 three-point field goals, which was a franchise record for the team. Field goal percentage: Field goal percentage in basketball is the \"ratio\" of field goals \"made\" to field goals \"attempted\".  Its abbreviation is FG%.  Although three-point field goal percentage is often calculated separately, three-point field goals are included in the general field goal percentage.  Instead of using scales of 0 to 100%, the scale .000 to 1.000 is commonly used.  A higher field goal percentage denotes higher efficiency.  In basketball, a FG% of .500 (50%) or above is considered a good percentage, although this criterion does not apply equally to all positions.  Guards usually have lower FG% than forwards and centers. Field goal percentage does not completely tell the skill of a player, but a low field goal percentage can indicate a poor offensive player or a player who takes many difficult shots.  In the NBA, Center Shaquille O'Neal has a high career FG% (around .580) because he plays near the basket making many high percentage layups and slam dunks. Guard Allen Iverson often had a low FG% (around .420) because he took the bulk of his team's shot attempts, even with high difficulty shots. Splash Brothers: The Splash Brothers are a duo of American basketball players consisting of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.  The two guards play professionally for the Golden State Warriors in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  Excellent long-range shooters, they have combined to set various NBA records for three-point field goals by a pair of teammates, and each has won the Three-Point Contest.  The two NBA All-Stars won NBA championship with the Warriors in 2015 and 2017. Travis Bader: Richard Travis Bader (born July 2, 1991) is an American professional basketball player who last played for Basket Recanati of the Serie A2.  He played college basketball for Oakland University.  Bader, a shooting guard, is the NCAA career leader for three-point field goals and field goal attempts.  He led the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I in three-point field goals per game during his junior season, averaging 4.21 three-pointers made per game. Chris Engler: Chris Engler (born March 1, 1959) is an American former National Basketball Association (NBA) player.  Engler was drafted from the University of Wyoming by the Golden State Warriors in the third round of the 1982 NBA draft.  Engler began his collegiate career with the Minnesota Golden Gophers before transferring to Wyoming.  Engler played two seasons with the Warriors, then subsequently had short stints with the Milwaukee Bucks, Chicago Bulls, New Jersey Nets, and Portland Trail Blazers before staying with the Nets for the final two seasons of his NBA career.  Engler finished with career averages of 1.8 points per game and 2.0 rebounds per game. 1996\u201397 Orlando Magic season: The 1996\u201397 NBA season was the Magic's eighth season in the National Basketball Association.  After losing Shaquille O'Neal via free agency to the Los Angeles Lakers in the offseason, the Magic acquired Rony Seikaly from the Golden State Warriors, and signed free agents Gerald Wilkins and Derek Strong.  Early into the season, the Magic played two games against the New Jersey Nets in Tokyo, Japan.  Head coach Brian Hill was fired 49 games into the season after a 24\u201325 start, and Anfernee Hardaway was generally blamed for leading a player revolt that resulted in his dismissal.  Hill was replaced with Richie Adubato for the remainder of the season as the Magic finished third in the Atlantic Division with a 45\u201337 record.  Hardaway was selected for the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, despite playing just 59 games due to a knee injury. 1990\u201391 Houston Rockets season: The 1990\u201391 NBA season was the Rockets' 24th season in the National Basketball Association, and 20th season in the city of Houston.  In the offseason, the Rockets acquired Kenny Smith from the Atlanta Hawks.  The Rockets continued to play .500 basketball during the first half of the season as Hakeem Olajuwon missed 26 games due to injuries.  However, the Rockets showed improvement by posting a 14\u20131 record in March, which included a 13-game winning streak.  They finished third in the Midwest Division with a 52\u201330 record.  Smith provided a spark averaging 17.7 points per game, while Vernon Maxwell averaged 17.0 points per game and led the league with 172 three-point field goals.  Head coach Don Chaney was named Coach of The Year.  However, in the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets were swept by the Los Angeles Lakers in three straight games."

Doda ,Chak Jarralan in nowshera and across the rajouri and some places in jammu the main families of Hindu Jarral Rajput are found and the Muslim Jarrals are found in Azad Kashmir, Noweshra and Rajouri-poonch. But there are majority of Muslims in this caste.  In the Dogra rule the Battle Hardy Jarral Rajputs enjoyed fighting with Dogra and in the war between them Jarral Rajputs and Dogras the Jarrals defeated the Dogra badly. Chaerophyllum elegans: Chaerophyllum elegans is a flowering plant species in the genus \"Chaerophyllum\" found in the Alps from Switzerland, France and Italy. Quakers in Europe: The Quaker movement began in England in the Seventeenth Century.  Small Quaker groups were planted in various places across Europe during this early period (For instance, see the Stephen Crisp article).  Quakers in Europe outside Britain and Ireland are not now very numerous although new groups have started in the former Soviet Union and satellite countries.  By far the largest national grouping of Quakers in Europe is in Britain. Cryptanthus: Cryptanthus is a genus in the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Bromelioideae.  The genus name is from the Greek \u201ccryptos\u201d (hidden) and \u201canthos\u201d (flower).  This genus has two recognized subgenera: the type subgenus and \"Hoplocryptanthus\" .  All species of this genus are endemic to Brazil.  The common name for any \"Cryptanthus\" is \"Earth Star\". Italian classical music: Plainsong is also called plainchant.  More specific terms such as Gregorian chant, Ambrosian chant, Gallican chant are also found.  Generally speaking, they all refer to a style of monophonic, unaccompanied, early Christian singing performed by monks and developed in the Roman Catholic Church mainly during the period 800-1000 .  The differences may be marginal\u2014or even great, in some cases.  These differences reflect the great ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity that existed after the fall of the Roman Empire on the Italian peninsula.  Different monastic traditions arose within the Roman Catholic Church throughout Italy, but at different places and at different times.  Even a musical non-specialist can hear the difference, for example, between the straightforward tone production in the Ambosian chants from Milan and the chants from Benevento, which display a distinct \"eastern\" ornamental quiver in the voice, reflecting the vocal traditions of the Greek Orthodox Church.  Yet, in spite of the differences, the similarities are great.  In any event, the formal Gregorian chant was imposed throughout Italy by 1100, although the music of Greeks rites continued to be heard at various places on the peninsula, especially in those places which Byzantium had once held, such as Ravenna or in the southern peninsula, which had been a refuge for those Greeks fleeing the great Byzantine iconoclast controversies before the year 1000.  Obviously, where Greek rites were practiced, the chants were sung in the Greek language and not in Latin, as they were in the Roman Catholic liturgy. Angiopteris evecta: Angiopteris evecta, commonly known as the giant fern, is a rare plant occurring in eastern and northern Australia and the Malay Peninsula.  Also found growing in nearby islands such as Borneo, Sumatra, New Guinea and various places in Polynesia, Melanesia and Madagascar.  Listed as endangered in New South Wales, where it has been recorded growing in sub tropical rainforest, in the valley of the Tweed River.  It is an invasive species in Hawaii and Jamaica. Ground stable barn: Ground stable barns are a relatively modern type of barn design found in many places across the United States.  Mostly constructed after 1910 when government health regulations associated with the dairy industry were altered forcing changes in barn design."

Martin Heidegger and Nazism: Philosopher Martin Heidegger joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) on May 1, 1933, ten days after being elected Rector of the University of Freiburg.  A year later, in April 1934, he resigned the Rectorship and stopped taking part in Nazi Party meetings, but remained a member of the Nazi Party until its dismantling at the end of World War II.  The denazification hearings immediately after World War II led to Heidegger's dismissal from Freiburg, banning him from teaching.  In 1949, after several years of investigation, the French military finally classified Heidegger as a \"Mitl\u00e4ufer\" or \"Nazi follower\".  The teaching ban was lifted in 1951 and Heidegger was granted \"emeritus\" status in 1953, but he was never allowed to resume his philosophy chair. Otto Telschow: Otto Telschow (27 February 1876, Wittenberge, Brandenburg \u2013 31 May 1945), a German Nazi Party official, was born in Wittenberge and became a police official in Hamburg.  Telschow joined the German Social Party in 1905.  In 1925 he joined the Nazi Party, and was the founder of the regional Nazi newspaper, the \"Niedersachsen-St\u00fcrmer\".  In October 1928, Telschow was appointed Gauleiter (regional party leader) of the Nazi party's regional subsection Gau Eastern Hanover, a post he retained until the end of World War II.  Telschow gained more influence after 1935, when the Nazi-party \"Gaue\" usurped the functions of the streamlined German states.  In 1930 he was elected to the Reichstag for the Ost-Hannover electoral district, and remained a member until 1945.  He was taken prisoner by the British Army at L\u00fcneburg and committed suicide in prison by slashing his wrists. Otto Strasser: Otto Johann Maximilian Strasser (also German: \"Stra\u00dfer\" , see \u00df; 10 September 1897 \u2013 27 August 1974) was a German politician and an early member of the Nazi Party.  Otto Strasser, together with his brother Gregor Strasser, was a leading member of the party's left-wing faction, and broke from the party due to disputes with the dominant \u2018Hitlerite\u2019 faction.  He formed the Black Front, a group intended to split the Nazi Party and take it from the grasp of Hitler.  This group also functioned during his exile and World War II as a secret opposition group. Der St\u00fcrmer: Der St\u00fcrmer (] , lit.  \"The Stormer/Attacker/Striker\") was a weekly German tabloid-format newspaper published by Julius Streicher, the Gauleiter of Franconia, from 1923 to the end of World War II, with brief suspensions in publication due to legal difficulties.  It was a significant part of Nazi propaganda and was vehemently anti-Semitic.  The paper was not an official publication of the Nazi party, but was published privately by Streicher.  For this reason, the paper did not display the Nazi party swastika in its logo.  The paper was a very lucrative business for Streicher, and made him a multi-millionaire. Blood and Soil: Blood and soil (German: \"Blut und Boden\" ) is a slogan expressing the nineteenth-century German idealization of a racially defined national body (\"blood\") united with a settlement area (\"soil\").  By it, rural and farm life forms are not only idealized as a counterweight to urban ones, but are also combined with racist and anti-Semitic ideas of a sedentary Germanic-Nordic peasantry as opposed to (specifically Jewish) nomadism.  The contemporary German concept Lebensraum, the belief that the German people needed to reclaim historically German areas of Eastern Europe into which they could expand, is tied to it. Karl-Heinz Schnibbe: Karl-Heinz Schnibbe (January 5, 1924\u00a0\u2013 May 9, 2010) was a former World War II resistance group member who, as a 17-year-old growing up in Nazi Germany in 1941, was an accomplice in a plan by three German teenagers, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), to distribute information to the citizens of Germany on the evils of the Nazi regime during World War II.  Led by 16-year-old Helmuth H\u00fcbener, the three boys created, posted and distributed cards and pamphlets denouncing Hitler and the Nazi party.  They were eventually caught by the Gestapo and, after repeated beatings, were convicted and sentenced.  H\u00fcbener was executed, the youngest person to be sentenced to death for opposing the Third Reich, and Schnibbe was sentenced to five years in a labor camp.  After the war and his release from a Soviet POW camp, Schnibbe emigrated to the United States in 1952, living in the Salt Lake City, Utah area until his death on May 9, 2010. Nazi Party of Costa Rica: The Nazi Party of Costa Rica (Spanish: \"Partido Nazi de Costa Rica\" ) was the name of a Costa Rican movement during the 1930s.  It was never legalized as a political party but was well organized and supported Nazi Germany during World War II. Betriebsobmann: Betriebsobmann was a political position of the Nazi Party which existed between the years 1939 and 1945.  The term first came into being at the start of World War II and was unique only to the local level of the Nazi Party, known as the \"Ortsgruppen\"."

    "question": "Who conducted the negotiations  with the owners and the longest serving commandant of Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp? Context: Gerstein Report: The Gerstein Report was written in 1945 by Kurt Gerstein, an Obersturmf\u00fchrer (First Lieutenant) of the Waffen-SS who rose to become the Head of Technical Disinfection Services of the SS, and in that capacity supplied hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B) from Degesch (\"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Sch\u00e4dlingsbek\u00e4mpfung\") to Rudolf H\u00f6ss in Auschwitz and conducted the negotiations with the owners.  On 17 August 1942, together with Rolf G\u00fcnther and Wilhelm Pfannenstiel, Gerstein witnessed the gassing of some 3,000 Jews in the extermination camp of Belzec in occupied Poland.  The report features his eyewitness testimony.  It was used as evidence in the Nuremberg Trials. Auschwitz concentration camp: Auschwitz concentration camp (German: \"Konzentrationslager Auschwitz\" , ] , also \"KZ Auschwitz \" or \"KL Auschwitz \") was a network of German Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps built and operated by the Third Reich in Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany during World War II.  It consisted of (the original camp), Auschwitz II\u2013Birkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps. Birkenau (disambiguation): Birkenau commonly refers to the Nazi German extermination camp Auschwitz II\u2013Birkenau in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II, located near Brzezinka, Poland. Majdanek concentration camp: Majdanek, or KL Lublin, was a German concentration and extermination camp built and operated by the SS on the outskirts of the city of Lublin during the German occupation of Poland in World War II.  Although initially purposed for forced labor rather than extermination, the camp was used to kill people on an industrial scale during Operation Reinhard, the German plan to murder all Jews within their own General Government territory of Poland.  The camp, which operated from October 1, 1941, until July 22, 1944, was captured nearly intact, because the rapid advance of the Soviet Red Army during \"Operation Bagration\" prevented the \"SS\" from destroying most of its infrastructure, and the inept Deputy Camp Commandant Anton Thernes failed in his task of removing incriminating evidence of war crimes.  Therefore, Majdanek became the first concentration camp discovered by Allied forces.  Also known to the \"SS\" as \"Konzentrationslager Lublin\", Majdanek remains the best preserved Nazi concentration camp of the Holocaust. Krak\u00f3w Ghetto: The Krak\u00f3w Ghetto was one of five major, metropolitan Jewish ghettos created by Nazi Germany in the new General Government territory during the German occupation of Poland in World War II.  It was established for the purpose of exploitation, terror, and persecution of local Polish Jews, as well as the staging area for separating the \"able workers\" from those who would later be deemed unworthy of life.  The Ghetto was liquidated between June 1942 and March 1943, with most of its inhabitants sent to their deaths at Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp as well as P\u0142asz\u00f3w slave-labor camp, and Auschwitz concentration camp, 60 km rail distance. Jasenovac concentration camp: The Jasenovac concentration camp (/\u041b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440 \u0408\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0446, ] ; Yiddish: \u05d9\u05d0\u05e1\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05e5\u200e ) was an extermination camp established in Slavonia by the authorities of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) during World War II.  The camp was established by the governing Usta\u0161e regime and not operated by Nazi Germany.  It was one of the largest concentration camps in Europe and the camp has been referred to as \"the Auschwitz of the Balkans\" and \"the Yugoslav Auschwitz\". Monowitz concentration camp: Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was initially established as a subcamp of Nazi Germany's Auschwitz concentration camp.  It was one of the three main camps in the Auschwitz concentration camp system, with an additional 45 subcamps in the surrounding area.  It was named after the village of Monowice (German: Monowitz) upon which it was built and was located in the annexed portion of Poland.  The SS established the camp in October 1942 at the behest of I.G. Farben executives to provide slave labor for their Buna Werke (Buna Works) industrial complex.  The name \"Buna\" was derived from the butadiene-based synthetic rubber and the chemical symbol for sodium (Na), a process of synthetic rubber production developed in Germany.  Various other German industrial enterprises built factories with their own subcamps, such as Siemens-Schuckert's Bobrek subcamp, close to Monowitz in order to profit from the use of slave labor.  The German armaments manufacturer Krupp, headed by SS member Alfried Krupp, also built their own manufacturing facilities near Monowitz. SS command of Auschwitz concentration camp: The SS command of Auschwitz concentration camp refers to those units, commands, and agencies of the German SS which operated and administered the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II.  Due to its large size and key role in the Nazi genocide program, the Auschwitz Concentration Camp encompassed personnel from several different branches of the SS, some of which held overlapping and shared areas of responsibility. Rudolf H\u00f6ss: Rudolf H\u00f6ss (also H\u00f6\u00df, Hoe\u00df or Hoess; 25 November 1901 \u2013 16 April 1947) was a Nazi German \"SS\"-\"Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer\" (lieutenant colonel) and the longest-serving commandant of Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp in World War II.  He tested and carried into effect various methods to accelerate Hitler's plan to systematically exterminate the Jewish population of Nazi-occupied Europe, known as the \"Final Solution\".  On the initiative of one of his subordinates, SS-\"Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer\" (captain) Karl Fritzsch, H\u00f6ss introduced pesticide Zyklon B containing hydrogen cyanide to the killing process, thereby allowing SS soldiers at Auschwitz to murder 2,000 people every hour.  He created the largest installation for the continuous annihilation of human beings ever known. Carl Clauberg: Carl Clauberg (28 September 1898 \u2013 9 August 1957) was a German gynecologist who conducted medical experiments on human subjects (mainly Jewish) at Auschwitz concentration camp.  He worked with Horst Schumann in X-ray sterilization experiments at Auschwitz concentration camp."

Though Baxter Springs had lost an election to choose the county seat in 1869 to Columbus, supporters of both cities had attempted to fraudulently swing the election in their favor, and Baxter Springs hoped it could still become county seat in the future.  The building initially served as the county jail and sheriff's office until Columbus completed its jail in 1880.  After this, Baxter Springs ultimately gave up its attempts to become the county seat, and the building became its city hall.  In 1905, resident Niles P. Johnston bequeathed $5,000 to the city to start a library, and the city hall building was chosen to house it. List of counties in Florida: There are 67 counties in the state of Florida.  It became a territory of the U.S. in 1821 with two counties complementing the provincial divisions retained as a Spanish territory: Escambia to the west and St. Johns to the east, divided by the Suwannee River.  All of the other counties were apportioned from these two original counties.  Florida became the 27th U.S. state in 1845, and its last county was created in 1925 with the formation of Gilchrist County from a segment of Alachua County.  Florida's counties are subdivisions of the state government.  In 1968, counties gained the power to develop their own charters. All but two of Florida's county seats are incorporated municipalities.  The exceptions are Crawfordville, county seat of rural Wakulla County, and East Naples, located outside Naples city limits in Collier County. Cerro Gordo County Courthouse (Iowa): The Cerro Gordo County Courthouse is located in Mason City, Iowa, United States.  When Cerro Gordo County was created in 1855 and Mason City was selected to be the county seat.  Dissatisfaction in the western part of the county led the Iowa legislature to appoint three new commissioners who would move the county seat to Livonia.  A courthouse was built there.  A petition signed by over half of the citizens of the county requested that the county seat be moved back to Mason City.  Mason City also won the election in 1858 to decide the matter 155-48.  Two courthouses have stood in Mason City prior to the present Modernist structure that was occupied by the county in 1960.  It had been built as the Standard Oil Building, and was acquired by the county in 1959 for $159,400 and then remodeled for their use."

    "question": "Which dog is believed to dispel ghosts and evil spirits, Segugio Italiano or Sapsali? Context: Nightmarchers: In Hawaiian legend, Nightmarchers (\"huaka'i p\u014d\" or \"Spirit Ranks,\" \" 'oi'o\") are the ghosts of ancient Hawaiian warriors.  On the nights of Kane, Ku, Lono, or on the nights of Kanaloa they are said to come forth from their burial sites to march out to past battles or to other sacred places.  They march at sunset and just before the sun rises.  Anyone living near their path may hear chanting and marching, and must go inside to avoid notice.  They might appear during the day if coming to escort a dying relative to the spirit world.  Anyone looking upon or seen by the marchers will die unless a relative is within the marchers' ranks- some people maintain that if you lie face down on the ground they will not see you.  This is to show respect.  However, if exiting the area is the fastest option, it is recommended.  Placing leaves of the ti (\"Cordyline\" sp.)  around one's home is said to keep away all evil spirits, and will cause the huaka'i p\u014d to avoid the area.  Another thing is to always highly respect the night marchers which can result in great things. Shisa: Shisa (\u30b7\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc , Sh\u012bs\u0101 , Okinawan: \"shiisaa\") is a traditional Ryukyuan cultural artifact and decoration, often seen in similar pairs, resembling a cross between a lion and a dog, from Okinawan mythology.  In magic typology, they are sometimes also be classified as gargoyle beasts.  Shisa are wards, believed to protect from some evils.  People place pairs of shisa on their rooftops or flanking the gates to their houses, with the left shisa traditionally has a closed mouth, the right one an open mouth.  The open mouth traditionally wards off evil spirits, and the closed mouth keeps good spirits in. Ba-Jia-Jiang: Ba Jia Jiang (\u516b\u5bb6\u5c07) originated from the Chinese folk beliefs and myths, and usually generally refers to eight members of the godly realm.  The general understanding of the origin of Ba Jia Jiang is that it is derived from the existence of eight generals who performed exorcism of evil spirits for the Wufu Emperor (\u4e94\u798f\u5927\u5e1d).  These eight generals became revered as the gods of the underworld, and are represented as the bodyguards or attendants for the temples of the nether Gods such as the Dongyue Emperor (\u6771\u7344\u5927\u5e1d), Yama (King of Hell, \u95bb\u7f85\u738b) and Cheng Huang (the City Gods, \u57ce\u968d).  Gradually Ba Jia Jiang evolved to appear also as bodyguards to Wang Ye (Royal Lord, \u738b\u723a) and Matsu (\u5abd\u7956), and at many other temples.  Later on, believers at those temples dressed up as Ba Jia Jiang in order to defend the Gods.  These actions evolved into Taiwanese folk activities, which are part of the Wu Array (Military Array, \u6b66\u9663) in Din Tao (Taiwanese troupes, \u9663\u982d).  Ba Jia Jiang is responsible for the capture of ghosts and evil spirits, bringing safety and good luck, and providing protection.  They contain a strong religious nature, and Din Tao (Taiwanese troupes, \u9663\u982d) often seem as mysterious, threatening and serious.  Some Ba Jia Jiang members have relations with Taiwanese gangsters. Kukeri: Kukeri (Bulgarian: \u043a\u0443\u043a\u0435\u0440\u0438 ; singular: kuker, \u043a\u0443\u043a\u0435\u0440) are elaborately costumed Bulgarian men who perform traditional rituals intended to scare away evil spirits.  Closely related traditions are found throughout the Balkans and Greece (including Romania and the Pontus).  The costumes cover most of the body and include decorated wooden masks of animals (sometimes double-faced) and large bells attached to the belt.  Around New Year and before Lent, the kukeri walk and dance through villages to scare away evil spirits with their costumes and the sound of their bells.  They are also believed to provide a good harvest, health, and happiness to the village during the year. Sapsali: The Sapsali (\uc0bd\uc0b4\uc774) is a shaggy Korean breed of dog.  The word is followed in Korean by either \"gae\" (meaning \"dog\") or the suffix \"ee\"/\"i\", but is most commonly romanized as \"Sapsaree\".  Traditionally, these dogs were believed to dispel ghosts and evil spirits. Segugio Italiano: The Segugio Italiano ] is an Italian breed of dog of the scenthound family.  It comes in both short-haired and wire-haired varieties.  It is thought to be an ancient breed, descended in pre-Roman eras from progenitor scenthounds in ancient Egypt.  In 2009 ENCI (the Italian Kennel Club) registered 4,500 specimens of the short-haired variety and 1,740 wire-haired specimens, making this one of the top ten breeds in Italy. Ugly Way: Ugly Way (also known as Ghost Way) is a healing rite used by Native Americans to cure sickness caused by ghosts, demons, and other evil spirits.  It is part of the way between H\u00f3zh\u00f3 and Hocho, Order and Chaos.  Early Christian missionaries linked it to the War in Heaven or the forces of good and evil, but it has more similarities to eastern concepts, for example yin and yang. Ghosts in Bengali culture: Ghosts are an important part of the folklore, and form an integral part of the socio-cultural beliefs of the people living in the geographical and ethno-linguistic region of Bengal, which today consists of the independent nation of Bangladesh, and the Indian states of West Bengal.  Fairy tales, both old and new, often use the concept of ghosts.  In modern-day Bengali literature, cinema and also in radio & television media, the references to ghosts are often found.  There are also many alleged haunted sites in this region.  It is believed that the spirits of those who cannot find peace in the afterlife or die unnatural deaths remain on Earth.  The common word for ghosts in Bengali is \"bhoot\" or \"bhut\" (Bengali: \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 ).  This word has an alternative meaning: 'past' in Bengali.  Also, the word \"Pret\" (derived from Sanskrit 'Preta') is used in Bengali to mean ghost.  In Bengal, ghosts are believed to be the spirit after death of an unsatisfied human being or a soul of a person who dies in unnatural or abnormal circumstances (like murder, suicide or accident).  Even it is believed that other animals and creatures can also be turned into ghost after their death. Witch ball: A witch ball is a hollow sphere of colored glass traditionally used as a fishing float.  Modern witches balls are decorative replicas.  Some are made to look like Christmas tree baubles that contain a few thin fibers strung inside.  Floating glass buoys became connected with witches during the witch hunts in England.  In the late 17th century, suspected witches were tried by being tied up and thrown into water.  If the water rejected them from a second baptism and they floated, then the suspects were confirmed as witches, under the rule of trial by water, and they were then hung by the neck until dead.  In a like manner these heavy glass fishing floats, all tied up in a net, could not be made to sink.  The water rejected them and they bobbed merrily upon its surface.  Historically, witch's balls were hung in cottage windows in 17th and 18th century England to ward off evil spirits, witches, evil spells, ill fortune and bad spirits.  Just as hanging a witch was believed to remove evil influences from a village, hanging a tried and tested witch's ball that had been floating in water, around a home, was believed to protect the home from similar ills.  Usage has continued to a smaller extent in America up to the present day. Ogbanje: An \u1eccgbanje (strictly \"\u1eccgbanje\" and cannot be substituted with \"\u1eccbanje\", the \"gb\" forms a single consonant in Igbo language) is a term in \u1eccd\u1ecbnan\u1ecb for what was believed to be an evil spirit that would deliberately plague a family with misfortune.  Its literal translation in the Igbo language is \"children who come and go\".  It was believed that within a certain amount of time from birth (usually not past puberty), the \u1eccgbanje would deliberately die and then come back and repeat the cycle causing the family grief.  Female circumcision was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit, whereas finding the evil spirits \"Iyi-\u1ee5wa\", which they had dug somewhere secret, would ensure the \u1eccgbanje would never plague the family with misfortune again.  The \"Iyi-\u1ee5wa\" was the \u1eccgbanje's way of coming back to the world and also a way of finding its targeted family."

It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer (arising from the lower portion of the uterus) being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries.  Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries.  Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer.  Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop.  If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods.  When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required.

Other terms for this type of art can be \"urban art\", \"guerrilla art\", \"independent public art\", \"post-graffiti\", and \"neo-graffiti\".

Surgical biopsy is the method of choice for diagnosis of most equine skin cancers, but is contraindicated for cases of sarcoids.  Prognosis and treatment effectiveness varies based on type of cancer, degree of local tissue destruction, evidence of spread to other organs (metastasis) and location of the tumor.  Not all cancers metastasize and some can be cured or mitigated by surgical removal of the cancerous tissue or through use of chemotherapeutic drugs.

    "question": "Which has more species, Lysiloma or Hydrocotyle umbellata? Context: Lysiloma: Lysiloma is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Epidendrum subsect. Umbellata: Epidendrum\" subsect.  \"Umbellata is a subsection of section \"E\". \u00a0sect. \u00a0\"Planifolia\" of subgenus \"E\". \u00a0subg. \u00a0\"Epidendrum\" of the genus \"Epidendrum\" of the Orchidaceae (orchid family).  Plants of \"E\". \u00a0subsect. \u00a0\"Umbellata\" differ from the other subsections of \"E\". \u00a0sect. \u00a0\"Planifolia\" by producing inflorescences which are umbel-like.  In 1861, Reichenbach recognized ten species in this subsection.  Of these, nine are recognized with the same names by Kew (page numbers refer to Reichenbach): Coeloplana fishelsoni: Coeloplana fishelsoni is a species of benthic comb jelly from the Red Sea, that lives as an episymbiont on colonies of \"Xenia umbellata\" and \"Paralemnalia\" species.  It can be differentiated from its cogenerate species by their host, colour, and colour pattern. Elaeagnus umbellata: Elaeagnus umbellata is known as Japanese silverberry, umbellata oleaster, autumn olive, autumn elaeagnus, or spreading oleaster.  The species is indigenous to eastern Asia and ranges from the Himalayas eastwards to Japan.  Because it fixes atmospheric nitrogen in its roots, it often grows vigorously and competitively in infertile soils. Sabicu wood: Sabicu wood or sabicu is the wood of at least two species of the genus \"Lysiloma\". \" Lysiloma sabicu\" (L.) Benth.  occurs sparingly in the Bahamas, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and Cuba.  It was named by George Bentham (1800-1884) from a Cuban specimen examined in 1854.  Bentham went on to identify a second species, \"Lysiloma latisiliquum\" (L.) Benth., which grows best in the Bahamas.  The latter is commonly known as 'wild tamarind' or 'false tamarind'.  The wood of both species is similar, being mid-brown in colour, sometimes with a reddish hue, heavy (specific gravity of 0.40-0.75) hard and durable.  Some timber is well figured, but most relatively plain.  The wood has been used in construction, shipbuilding and in furniture making, although its weight is a distinct drawback for the latter purpose.  The stairs of The Crystal Palace in London, in which The Great Exhibition of 1851 was held, were made of sabicu due to its durability.  Despite the enormous traffic that passed over them, the wood at the end was found to be little affected by wear. Hunteria umbellata: Hunteria umbellata grows as either a shrub or small tree up to 22 m tall, with a trunk diameter of up to 40 cm .  Its flowers feature a white, creamy or pale yellow corolla.  The fruit is yellow and smooth.  Its habitat is forests from sea level to 600 m altitude.  Its numerous local medicinal uses include for fever, leprosy sores, stomach and liver problems and as an anthelmintic, especially against internal worms.  \"Hunteria umbellata\" has been used as arrow poison.  The plant's hard wood is used in carving and to make small tools.  The species is native to west and west-central tropical Africa. Hydrocotyle ranunculoides: Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, known commonly as water pennywort, floating pennywort, or floating marshpennywort, is an aquatic plant in the family Apiaceae.  It is native to North and South America and parts of Africa.  In the United Kingdom it is an invasive alien species which is currently spreading in waterways.  It was one of five aquatic plants which were banned from sale in the UK from April 2014, and was the first prohibition of its kind there.  Water pennywort is also a weed in Australia.  On the other hand, it is a threatened species in parts of its native range in the United States. Hydrocotyle javanica: Hydrocotyle javanica, commonly known as Java pennywort, is a species of \"Hydrocotyle\".  It is a prostrate herb found in NE India and SE Asia.  Leaves are simple, circular-heart-shaped, with seven triangular shallow lobes.  Leaves are 2.5-5 x 3-5.5 cm in size, and the margin has rounded teeth.  Java pennywort is closely related to Indian pennywort.  Tiny white flowers arise in 20 flowered umbels.  Java pennywort is seen in shady, moist places at altitudes greater than 1300 m. Flowers have five greenish-white petals and five stamens.  Fruit is broadly ovoid, 1 mm, laterally compressed.  In Manipur, the leaves are eaten as a substitute for Indian pennywort.  Flowering: June-July. Lysiloma latisiliquum: Lysiloma latisiliquum, commonly known as false tamarind or wild tamarind, is a species of tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to southern Florida in the United States, The Bahamas, the Caribbean, southern Mexico, and northern Central America. Hydrocotyle umbellata: Hydrocotyle umbellata, is an aquatic plant that thrives in wet, sandy habitat.  Its English common name is manyflower marshpennywort or dollarweed.  It is native to North America and parts of South America.  It can also be found growing as an introduced species and sometimes a noxious weed on other continents.  It is an edible weed that can be used in salads or as a pot herb."

Context: Pumping Iron &amp; Sweating Steel: Pumping Iron & Sweating Steel: The Best of the Iron City Houserockers is a compilation album by the Iron City Houserockers.  Released in 1992 under Rhino Records, it was at that time the only Iron City Houserockers material available on compact disc (\"Love's So Tough\" and \"Have a Good Time but Get out Alive!\"  would not be reissued on CD for another seven years after this compilation appeared).  The disc covers all four of the Iron City Houserockers albums from the late seventies and early eighties and places them in chronological order with a few extra tracks thrown in to make it a worthy buy for collectors.  Tracks 1\u20135 were taken from \"Love's So Tough\", with \"School Days\", a Chuck Berry cover, being an unreleased outtake from that album.  Tracks 6\u201311 were taken from \"Have a Good Time but Get out Alive! \", but with the single edit version of \"Junior's Bar\".  Tracks 12\u201315 were taken from \"Blood on the Bricks\", tracks 16\u201317 from \"Cracking Under Pressure\" and \"Goodbye Steeltown\", a Joe Grushecky single released in August 1984 (after the band had broken up), was included as the final song.  The songs were remastered for compact disc by Bill Inglot.

Released in 1979, the Iron City Houserocker's first album attempts to capture the presence of what was essentially a Pittsburgh bar band playing to a blue collar crowd every night.  While Joe Grushecky's songwriting skills are clearly still developing, his potential is visible in cuts such as \"Dance with Me\" and \"Heros Are Hard to Find\".  The general sound of the album is reminiscent of a slightly \"harder\" Bruce Springsteen, and the heavy use of harmonica would be a distinguishing factor of the Houserockers for several albums to come.  The Chuck Berry song \"School Days (Ring!  Ring!  Goes the Bell)\" was recorded for the album but was cut from the final release.  The track was then released on \"Pumping Iron & Sweating Steel: The Best of the Iron City Houserockers\".  The album was reissued in CD format in 1999.

    "question": "Which king of Northumbria did The \"Historia\" gives the abbot central place in his election as king Context: Borhat: Borhat (\u09ac\u09f0\u09b9\u09be\u099f) is the eastern part of the newly formed Charaideo district, Assam.  It is separated from Namrup in the east by the river Disang or Dilih.  In the west Sapekhati, in south Arunachal Pradesh, in north are parts of Dibrugarh district including Namrup, Assam.  There is a small railway station named Borhat(BFD) which is in the central place of the region.  During Ahom rule, Borhat was famous as a place for finding mineral salt.  The name Borhat is originated from Bor '\u09ac\u09f0' (meaning big '\u09a1\u09be\u0999\u09f0' ) and hat '\u09b9\u09be\u099f' (market '\u09ac\u099c\u09be\u09f0').  T here was a market place where salt was available.  Salt was considered to be very precious during Ahom rule as Assam is far from the seas and people had to use only mineral salts. Wilfrid: Wilfrid (c.  633\u00a0\u2013 c. 709) was an English bishop and saint.  Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon.  In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted.  His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria.  Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time.  During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop.  Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria. Kr\u00f6pcke: Kr\u00f6pcke is the central place of the city of Hanover in Germany.  The place is situated at the crossroads of Georgstra\u00dfe, Karmarschstra\u00dfe, Bahnhofstra\u00dfe and Rathenaustra\u00dfe.  It is named after \"Wilhelm Kr\u00f6pcke\", one of the owners of the former Caf\u00e9 Robby, which was erected on the then-nameless place in 1869.  Kr\u00f6pcke leased the caf\u00e9 in 1876, changed the business's name to \"Caf\u00e9 Kr\u00f6pcke\" and operated the caf\u00e9 until 1919.  Eventually, the place adopted the name from the caf\u00e9 and in 1948 was officially named \"Kr\u00f6pcke\" by the city of Hanover. Northman: Northman (Old English: \"Nor\u00feman\" ; fl.  994) was a late 10th-century English ealdorman (or earl), with a territorial base in Northumbria north of the River Tees.  He appears in two different strands of source.  These are, namely, the textual tradition of Durham witnessed by \"Historia de Sancto Cuthberto\" and the Durham \"Liber Vitae\", and an appearance in a witness list of a charter of King \u00c6thelred II dated to 994.  The latter is Northman's only appearance south of the Humber, and came the year after Northumbria was attacked by Vikings. Guthred: Guthred or Guthfrith (Old Norse: \"Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r\"; died 24 August 895) was the king of Northumbria from circa 883 until his death. Fulrad: Saint Fulrad (French: \"Fulrade\" ; Latin: \"Fulradus\" ) was born in 710 into a wealthy family, and died on July 16, 784 as the Abbot of St. Denis.  He was the counselor of both Pippin and Charlemagne.  Historians see Fulrad as important due to his significance in the rise of the Frankish Kingdom, and the insight he gives into early Carolingian society.  He was noted to have been always on the side on Charlemagne, especially during the attack from the Saxons on Regnum Franserum (Latin for Frankia), and the Royal Mandatum (a royal official of the Carolingian administrative hierarchy).  Other historians have taken a closer look at Fulrad\u2019s interactions with the papacy.  When Fulrad was the counselor of Pepin he was closely in contact with the papacy to gain approval for Pepin\u2019s appoint as King of the Franks.  During his time under Charlemagne, he had dealings with the papacy again for different reasons.  When he became Abbot of St. Denis (N.E of Paris), Fulrad\u2019s life became important in the lives of distinct historical figures in various ways during his period as St. Denis\u2019s abbot during the mid-eighth century.  Saint Fulrad\u2019s Feast Day is on July 16. Ceolwulf of Northumbria: Saint Ceolwulf was King of Northumbria from 729 until 737, except for a short period in 731 or 732 when he was deposed, and quickly restored to power.  Ceolwulf finally abdicated and entered the monastery at Lindisfarne.  He was the \"most glorious king\" to whom Bede dedicated his \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\". Rull Men's Meetinghouse: The Rull Men's Meetinghouse (known as a \"faluw\" in the Yapese language) is a historic meeting house in Rull, a village on the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia.  It is a large rectangular structure, set on a raised stone platform.  The flooring consists of treated betelnut palm trunks, and has a steeply pitched roof made of bamboo supports with various types of tropical leaves tied in place using coconut fiber.  The \"faluw\", although not the first built on this platform, has historically occupied a central place in the civic life of the community, serving as a place where the men of the village could meet in seclusion, and as a place for social rites. S\u00e6berht of Essex: S\u00e6berht, Saberht or S\u00e6bert (d. \"c\".  616) was a King of Essex (r. \"c\".  604\u00a0\u2013 \"c\".  616), in succession of his father King Sledd.  He is known as the first East Saxon king to have been converted to Christianity.  The principal source for his reign is the early 8th-century \"Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" by Bede (d. 735), who claims to have derived his information about the missionary work of Mellitus among the East Saxons from Abbot Albinus of Canterbury through the London priest Nothhelm, later Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 739).  Other sources include the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", an East Saxon genealogy possibly of the late 9th century (British Library MS Add.  23211), and a handful of genealogies and regnal lists written down by Anglo-Norman historians. Eadred Lulisc: Eadred Lulisc or Eadred of Carlisle (fl.  late 9th century) is the abbot of Carlisle recorded by the \"Historia de Sancto Cuthberto\".

The bulk of these changes were not visible to the public, but were to unsigned legislative designations only.  The primary effect was designating route numbers 1 through 5 for future corridors of the Interstate Highways in Utah.  There were also changes made to a few unsigned highways serving state parks and institutions.  Several other routes were truncated or re-assigned or split into multiple designations to allow the Interstate Highway corridors to have a single route number assigned.  As very little of the Interstate Highway System had been constructed in Utah by 1962, these changes were primarily to support future construction.  There were a number of cases where the legislative change enacted in 1962 would not be built and signed until years later.  Few of the changes made in 1962 are still valid today.  As construction of the Interstate Highway system proceeded, additional changes were made.  The legislature made a larger change in route designations in 1977, eliminating unsigned legislative and concurrences in the process. Interstate 22: Interstate 22 (I-22) is an Interstate Highway that follows the U.S. Route 78 (US 78) corridor on a 213 mi route from Byhalia, Mississippi south of Memphis, Tennessee, to Birmingham, Alabama.  I-22 indirectly connects I-240, I-40, I-55, and I-69 in the northwest with I-65 and I-20/I-59 in the southeast.  When designated in 2012, it was designed to close a gap in the Interstate network allowing more direct connections between cities in the southeast (such as Atlanta and Birmingham) with those of the Great Plains (such as Oklahoma City and St. Louis)."

Fortean Society: The Fortean Society was started in the United States in 1931 during a meeting held in the New York flat of Charles Hoy Fort in order to promote the ideas of American writer Charles Fort.  The Fortean Society was primarily based in New York City.  Its first president was Theodore Dreiser, an old friend of Charles Fort, who had helped to get his work published.  Founding members of The Fortean Society included Tiffany Thayer, Booth Tarkington, Ben Hecht, Alexander Woollcott (and many of NYC's literati such as Dorothy Parker), and Baltimore writer H. L. Mencken.  Other members included Vincent Gaddis, Ivan T. Sanderson, A. Merritt, Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller.  The first 6 issues of the Fortean Society's newsletter \"Doubt\" were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser.  Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues.  Thayer began to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter, reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society's direction, and forbidding them to use the name Fortean.  During World War II, for example, Thayer used every issue of \"Doubt\" to espouse his politics.  Particularly, he frequently expressed opposition to Civil Defense, going to such lengths as encouraging readers to turn on their lights in defiance to air raid sirens.  In contrast to the spirit of Charles Fort, he not only dismissed flying saucers as nonsense, but also dismissed the atomic bomb as a hoax. UFO Magazine: \"UFO Magazine\" was an American magazine that was devoted to the subject of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), as well as paranormal and Fortean subjects in general. Ernest Charles Hoy: Captain Ernest Charles Hoy DFC (6 May 1895\u00a0\u201322 April 1982) was a Canadian First World War flying ace, officially credited with 13 victories.  He later pioneered airmail flight over the Canadian Rockies. Charles Fort: Charles Hoy Fort (August 6, 1874 \u2013 May 3, 1932) was an American writer and researcher who specialized in anomalous phenomena.  The terms \"Fortean\" and \"Forteana\" are sometimes used to characterize various such phenomena.  Fort's books sold well and are still in print.  His work continues to inspire admirers, who refer to themselves as \"Forteans\", and has influenced some aspects of science fiction. Michel Monnerie: Michel Monnerie (born 1940) is a French UFO researcher regarded in some European circles as the pioneer of the psychosocial hypothesis (PSH).  He authored two seminal works \"Et si les OVNIs n\u2019existaient pas?\"  (\"And What if UFOs don\u2019t exist?\") (1977) and \"Le naufrage des Extra-terrestres\" (\"The Shipwreck of the Extraterrestrials\")(1979) Prior to this, he was a member of the editorial board of \"Lumi\u00e8res dans la Nuit\", France\u2019s most respected ufo magazine, but was fired after the second book was published.

She was also the last editor-in-chief of UFO Magazine when that publication ceased publication.  She is currently the editor-in-chief of Filament Books.

She fought because her brother had recently been killed by the Sioux and she sought revenge against them.  Most of the Crow carried rifles, but The Other Magpie carried only her belt knife and her coup stick.  She counted coup on a Sioux warrior and eventually killed and scalped him.  The scalp that she took was one of only eleven taken in the battle.  Pretty Shield described her as having tied a feather on the end of her coup stick to symbolize her achievement.  Later, she cut the scalp into pieces and gave them to the male warriors so they would have more scalps for the dance after the battle. Second Battle of Caloocan: The Second Battle of Caloocan, alternately called the Second Battle of Manila, was fought from February 22 to 24, 1899, in Caloocan during the Philippine\u2013American War.  The battle featured a Filipino counterattack aimed at gaining Manila from the Americans.

    "question": "Are Dogo Cubano and the Dutch Shepherd both breeds of dog? Context: Schutzhund: Schutzhund (German for \"protection dog\") is a dog sport that was developed in Germany in the early 1900s as a breed suitability test for the German Shepherd breed.  The test would determine if the dog displayed the appropriate traits and characteristics of a proper working German Shepherd.  Today, it is used as a sport where many breeds other than German Shepherd Dogs can compete, but it is such a demanding test that few dogs can pass. Dutch Shepherd: The Dutch Shepherd is a herding dog of Dutch origin.  They were used by shepherds and farmers who needed a versatile dog, with few demands, and a dog that was able to adapt to a harsh and meager existence. Guatemalan Dogo: Guatemalan Dogo (\"Dogo Guatemalteco\"), formerly known as the Guatemalan Bull Terrier (\"Bullterrier Guatemalteco\"), and Guatemalan Mastiff, is a Molosser-type dog breed originating in Guatemala.  It is neither recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) nor the American Kennel Club (AKC).  However, it has the official national recognition of the Asociaci\u00f3n Canofila Guatemalteca (ACANGUA) where it belongs to the Group 2.2.1 - Mastiffs.  As the unique breed originating in Guatemala, it is also the national dog of the country.  Nowadays it has spread to various other countries, such as the USA. Dogo Cubano: Dogo Cubano also known as the Cuban Mastiff, Cuban Dogo and Cuban Dogge is an extinct dog breed from Cuba.  It was of the Bull Mastiff type and was used for dog fighting. Belgian Shepherd: The Belgian Shepherd (also known as the Belgian Sheepdog or Chien de Berger Belge) is a breed of medium-to-large-sized herding dog.  It originated in Belgium and is similar to other sheep herding dogs from that region, including the Dutch Shepherd, the German Shepherd, the Briard, and others.  Four types have been identified by various registries as separate breeds or varieties: Groenendael, Laekenois, Tervuren, and Malinois. Collie: The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds.  The type originated in Scotland and Northern England.  The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout.  Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.  Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call \"Collie\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.  They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity. Cuban Criollo: The Criollo Cubano originates from Spanish horses brought to Cuba by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez in 1751.  There are four different breeds known as criollo: the Cubano de Paso, the Pinto Cubano, the Criollo de Trote and the Patibarcino.  It is a small stout breed used by the Guajiro people. Dogo Argentino: The Dogo Argentino, also known as the Argentine Mastiff, is a large, white, muscular dog that was developed in Argentina primarily for the purpose of big-game hunting, including wild boar; the breeder, Antonio Nores Mart\u00ednez, also wanted a dog that would exhibit steadfast bravery and willingly protect its human companion.  It was first bred in 1928, from the Cordoba Fighting Dog along with a wide array of other breeds including the Great Dane. Chiribaya Dog: The Chiribaya Dog (Spanish: \"perro Chiribaya\" ) or Peruvian shepherd dog (\"perro pastor Peruano \") was a pre-Columbian breed of dog from the southwest of Peru, identified by the 42 mummies discovered by anthropologist Sonia Guill\u00e9n Oneglio in the Ilo District, Moquegua Region, on the south coast of Peru.  It has been established that it was a llama herding dog.  The dogs were not only an important part of the social structure of the ancient Peruvians, but they received special treatment after death as well.  The dog variety has been referred to in various Spanish-language documentaries under different terms, such as \"el perro pastor Chribaya\" ('the Chiribaya shepherd dog') and \"pastor Peruano \" ('Peruvian shepherd'), though the ancient Peruvians did not keep sheep.  Its original name is unknown.  (It has been referred to more ambiguously by the term \"perro Peruano \" or \"perro del Per\u00fa \" ('Peruvian dog', 'dog of Peru'), but this has also been applied to an extant but ancient hairless variety, referred to in more detail as \"perro sin pelo del Per\u00fa\", 'hairless dog of Peru', or the Peruvian hairless dog, a favorite in South American dog shows.) Romanian Raven Shepherd Dog: The Romanian Raven Shepherd Dog is a very large Romanian livestock guardian dog, taxonomized within the second group of dog breeds - Pinscher and Schanuzer - Molossoid Breeds - Swiss Mountain and Cattle Dogs, section 2.2: Molossoid Breeds - Mountain type."

She has a long-standing rivalry with Angela, but since Angela has gone rogue, Tiffany's aim is to fill her place as the top Hellspawn slayer in Heaven's army.  In her first attempt to slay Spawn, she was over-zealous and was defeated in a grisly manner.  Although she lost the fight, she escaped with her life, since the still inexperienced Spawn did not realize that merely destroying an angel's physical body is not enough to truly kill it.  She has not appeared in the comic since. Horace and Pete: Horace and Pete is a Peabody Award-winning American web series created, written, and directed by Louis C.K., who describes it as a tragedy rather than a comedy.

Created by writer/artist Todd McFarlane, the character first appeared in \"Spawn\" #1 (May 1992).

Context: Real Life with Jane Pauley: Real Life with Jane Pauley was a newsmagazine television program aired in the United States by NBC from 1990 to 1991.  \"Real Life with Jane Pauley\" seemed to be presented as an answer to both critics and members of the general public to the frequently-repeated viewpoint that \"television news never seems to show anything positive\".  \"Real Life\" focused on positive, human interest-type stories and occasional celebrity profiles.  Jane Pauley also presented less uplifting but still-lightweight features as well, such as a feature focusing on how less than 20% of the people who owned VCRs at the time actually knew how to program them.

He is on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of most wanted Nazi war criminals. Josef Mengele: Josef Mengele (] ; 16 March 19117 February 1979) was a German \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) officer and physician in Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II.

The DAT is simply one of two alternative means by which a person who is arrested appears for arraignment, or first appearance.  A person who receives a DAT is permitted to appear in court on their own on the date indicated on the DAT document.  A person who does not receive a DAT is processed through the arrest to arraignment system and is supposed to have their arraignment within 24 hours.  From the point that the case is arraigned, a DAT case is like any other criminal case.  DATs are usually only issued for misdemeanors in which there is little chance that the defendant will flee the jurisdiction; currently, DATs may be issued for violation, misdemeanors, and \"E\" felonies.  If a person fails to return to court on the date indicated on the DAT, the Court will issue an arrest warrant. Negative checking: Negative checking is a process by which producers of film, television and radio programs will attempt to ensure that the names of fictional characters cannot be confused with real life people.  For instance, during the making of the series \"Inspector Morse\", the producers of the show checked with local police authorities to check that the names of characters used in the program could not be confused with individuals in any real life cases.  The primary reason for this practice is to prevent any possible legal action for libel which could result.

Like the Halloween specials, the episode is considered non-canon and falls outside of the show's regular continuity. LOTUS (Supernatural): \"LOTUS\" is the eight episode and midseason finale of the paranormal drama television series \"Supernatural\"' s season 12, and the 249th overall.  The episode was written by Eugenie Ross-Leming and Brad Buckner and directed by Phil Sgriccia.  It was first broadcast on December 8, 2016, on The CW.  In the episode, Lucifer possesses influential people, going as far as to possess the President of the United States.  Using his new power, he tries to stop Sam and Dean from catching him. 249th Rifle Division (Soviet Union): The 249th Rifle Division was raised in 1941, within days of the German invasion, as a standard Red Army rifle division, and served for the duration of the Great Patriotic War in that role.  The division was formed twice, first from a cadre of NKVD soldiers that went on to become the 16th Guards Rifle Division after distinguishing themselves in the fighting for Toropets during the Soviet counteroffensive in the winter of 1941-42.  The second formation was largely made up of ethnic Estonians and was known as the 249th Estonian Rifle Division.  It fought under that name for the duration, and shortly after the German surrender became the 122nd Guards Rifle Division."

Context: 34th Street (IRT Ninth Avenue Line): 34th Street was an express station on the demolished IRT Ninth Avenue Line, New York, United States.  It was originally built on July 30, 1873 by the New York Elevated Railroad Company, and had two levels.  The lower level was built first and had two tracks and two side platforms.  The upper level was built as part of the Dual Contracts and had one track and two side platforms over the lower level local tracks.  It closed on June 11, 1940.  The next southbound local stop was 30th Street.  The next southbound express stop was 14th Street.  The next northbound local stop was 42nd Street.  The next northbound express stop was 66th Street.  This station also serviced Penn Station and was west of the IRT and IND subway stations at Penn Station. Abraham M. Radcliffe: Abraham M. Radcliffe (1827\u20131886) was an architect born in New York City.  He opened a Minneapolis office in 1857 and a St. Paul office in 1858.  He closed his Minneapolis office in 1868.  He designed early commercial buildings in St. Paul and Minneapolis, as well as the Dakota County Courthouse in Hastings, Minnesota.  Radcliffe inspired the architectural career of Cass Gilbert, the skyscraper pioneer who designed the Woolworth Building in New York City and the United States Supreme Court building, among many important public structures. Petroleum Building (Midland): The Petroleum Building (formerly known as the Hogan Building) is a highrise in downtown Midland, TX.  The building was built in 1928 and consists of 12 floors and has a neo-gothic style architecture to it.  The building stands at 137\u00a0ft but with its spires reaches a height of 151\u00a0ft. The Hogan building is a registered, Texas historical landmark.  The tower is named for lawyer and oil entrepreneur Thomas Stephen Hogan.  For information on Hogan, see article on Jacob Bunn.  The design of the Petroleum Building, like the Woolworth Building in New York City and the Baum Building in Oklahoma City, utilizes many classic architectural devices.  Gothic spires and Moorish arches, lavish carved surfaces and opulent marble, all intended to clothe the business house with the respectability of a cathedral.  Thomas Stephen Hogan intended his building to be a landmark and (Fort Worth architect-engineer) Wyatt Hedrick designed a building that people would talk about.  However, behind the ornate cast-stone fa\u00e7ade was (sic) functional reinforced concrete, the finest equipment available, and the determination of one man to establish Midland as the headquarters of the West Texas oil fields. Westchester Avenue (NYW&amp;B station): Westchester Avenue is a former railroad station located in the borough of the Bronx in New York City, partially suspended over Amtrak's busy Northeast Corridor line.  It was built in 1908 with rich terra cotta detailing to a design by Cass Gilbert, who would later employ similar terra cotta detailing in his 1910 design for the Woolworth Building.

Woolworth, the founder of the Woolworth's chain of department stores. 90 West Street: 90 West Street (alternatively West Street Building) is a building in Lower Manhattan, New York City.  It was designed by architect Cass Gilbert and structural engineer Gunvald Aus for the West Street Improvement Corporation.  When completed in 1907, the building's Gothic styling and ornamentation served to emphasize its 23-story height, and foreshadowed Gilbert's later work on the Woolworth Building.  Originally built as an office building, the main tenant was the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the top floor was occupied by Garret's Restaurant, which advertised itself as the \"world's highest restaurant\". Transportation Building: The Transportation Building is a 44-story office building located at 225 Broadway on the corner of Barclay Street in the Civic Center neighborhood of Lower Manhattan in New York City.

It sits across Barclay Street from the Woolworth Building. Woolworth Building: The Woolworth Building, at 233 Broadway, Manhattan, New York City, designed by architect Cass Gilbert and constructed between 1910 and 1912, is an early US skyscraper.  The original site for the building was purchased by F. W. Woolworth and his real estate agent Edward J. Hogan by April 15, 1910, from the Trenor Luther Park Estate and other owners for $1.65 million.  By January 18, 1911, Woolworth and Hogan had acquired the final site for the project, totaling $4.5 million.  More than a century after its construction, it remains, at 241.4 m , one of the 100 tallest buildings in the United States as well as one of the 30 tallest buildings in New York City.

He has a personal net worth of well over $10 billion, according to data company Real Capital Analytics.  The portfolio of Cammeby's, which Schron founded in 1967, includes office buildings, market-rate and government-subsidized apartment complexes, nursing homes, the 16-building complex in Sunset Park now known as Industry City, a stake in the bottom half of Woolworth Building and industrial properties scattered across Long Island.  In 2013, Schron made an unsolicited and unsuccessful offer to buy the Empire State Building for $2 billion, but he has not had problems closing many other deals throughout his long career.  In 2003, an investment group led by Schron paid $600 million for a portfolio of about 6,000 outer-borough apartments from Donald Trump.  Other buildings he owns include the Monterey, a 521-unit rental multifamily building on Manhattan's Upper East Side; over the decades, Schron has also amassed a portfolio of Mitchell-Lama apartment buildings whose values have been skyrocketing to record values, after reverting to market rates when government subsidies expired.  In 2007, he sold nearly 4,000 units of former Mitchell-Lama properties in five complexes in Harlem and on Roosevelt Island for $940 million.  Schron, who practices Orthodox Judaism, has eight children and 50 grandchildren.  He and his family have lived in the same single-family home in Brooklyn for many decades."

    "question": "When was the advisor of Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper died? Context: Ylem: Ylem is a term that was used by George Gamow, his student Ralph Alpher, and their associates in the late 1940s for a hypothetical original substance or condensed state of matter, which became subatomic particles and elements as we understand them today.  The term \"ylem\" was actually resuscitated (it appears in Webster's Second \"the first substance from which the elements were supposed to have been formed\") by Ralph Alpher. George Gamow: George Gamow (March 4 [O.S. February 20] 1904 August 19, 1968), born Georgiy Antonovich Gamov (Russian: \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0413\u0430\u0301\u043c\u043e\u0432 ; ] ), was a theoretical physicist and cosmologist.  He was an early advocate and developer of Lema\u00eetre's Big Bang theory.  He discovered a theoretical explanation of alpha decay via quantum tunneling, and worked on radioactive decay of the atomic nucleus, star formation, stellar nucleosynthesis and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (which he collectively called nucleocosmogenesis), and molecular genetics. Edward Teller: Edward Teller (Hungarian: \"Teller\u00a0Ede\" ; January 15, 1908\u00a0\u2013 September 9, 2003) was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist who was born in Hungary, and is known colloquially as \"the father of the hydrogen bomb\", although he claimed he did not care for the title.  He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (in particular the Jahn\u2013Teller and Renner\u2013Teller effects), and surface physics.  His extension of Enrico Fermi's theory of beta decay, in the form of Gamow\u2013Teller transitions, provided an important stepping stone in its application, while the Jahn\u2013Teller effect and the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.  Teller also made contributions to Thomas\u2013Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules.  In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis, Arianna Rosenbluth, Marshall Rosenbluth, and Augusta Teller, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics. Kate Gordon (energy analyst): Kate Gordon is an American lawyer, urban planner, non-profit advisor, and leader in the \u201cgreen jobs\u201d and climate risk movement.  She is currently an independent consultant and Senior Advisor at the Paulson Institute, where she provides strategic support on issues related to climate change and sustainable economic growth.  She is also a nonresident Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal as one of the paper\u2019s \u201cEnergy Experts. \u201d She currently serves on the non-profit boards of Vote Solar, Center for Carbon Removal, and the American Jobs Project and writes a regular newsletter on clean energy and climate called \"Kate's Cliffnotes\" Gilman Paper Company: The Gilman Paper Company was a paper producer that was started in the 1880s by Isaac Gilman in Gilman, Vermont.  In the 1940s his son Charles Gilman built an additional mill in St. Mary's, Georgia.  The company was capable of producing 2.6 million pounds of paper per day, employed 1,100 workers and 1,500 independent contractors, with an office in at 111 West 50th Street, New York.  At the death of Charles Gilman in 1967, the company was run by his two sons, Charles (Chris) Gilman Jr and Howard Gilman.  During this period the photography collection was started by Chris's wife Sondra Gilman, with the support of Chris and Howard.  At the death of Charles Jr, in January 1982, Howard bought the balance of the company from Charles's estate and both Gilman Paper and Sondra Gilman continued to collect photographs.  Howard Gilman died of a heart attack at his White Oak Plantation in Yulee, Florida in 1998.  The paper mill was subsequently sold to Durango Products of Mexico.  In 2002, Durango entered into bankruptcy, and the paper mill was shut down in September, 2002. Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation: The Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (named after Hans Bethe and Edwin Salpeter) describes the bound states of a two-body (particles) quantum field theoretical system in a relativistically covariant formalism.  The equation was actually first published in 1950 at the end of a paper by Yoichiro Nambu, but without derivation. Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper: In physical cosmology, the Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper, or \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 paper, was created by Ralph Alpher, then a physics PhD student, and his advisor George Gamow.  The work, which would become the subject of Alpher's PhD dissertation, argued that the Big Bang would create hydrogen, helium and heavier elements in the correct proportions to explain their abundance in the early universe.  While the original theory neglected a number of processes important to the formation of heavy elements, subsequent developments showed that Big Bang nucleosynthesis is consistent with the observed constraints on all primordial elements. N. J. Rao: N. J. Rao has done B.Tech (Hons.)  and M.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur and Ph.D.  in Chemical Engineering from University of Roorkee.  He served over 34 year's at IIT Roorkee / University of Roorkee at Chemical Engineering Department and Department of Paper Technology.  He worked for several years as Director of Institute of Paper Technology.  He was the Director of Central Pulp and Paper Research Institute, a national laboratory under Ministry of Industry (GOI) for one year.

He has been a visiting professor at NTH Trondheim (Norway).  He served as Editor / Editorial Advisor / National Editor for IPPTA Journal; CSIR Journal, In Paper International, Pulp and Paper International, Urja. Semi-empirical mass formula: In nuclear physics, the semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF) (sometimes also called Weizs\u00e4cker's formula, or the Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker formula, or the Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker mass formula to distinguish it from the Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker process) is used to approximate the mass and various other properties of an atomic nucleus from its number of protons and neutrons.  As the name suggests, it is based partly on theory and partly on empirical measurements.  The theory is based on the liquid drop model proposed by George Gamow, which can account for most of the terms in the formula and gives rough estimates for the values of the coefficients.  It was first formulated in 1935 by German physicist Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker, and although refinements have been made to the coefficients over the years, the structure of the formula remains the same today. Berkeley High Jacket: The Jacket is the student newspaper serving the roughly three thousand students of Berkeley High School, California.  The paper is published every other Friday and is usually sixteen pages long, with only the front, back, and two middle pages in color.  There are five sections in the paper: news, opinion, features, entertainment, and sports.  The staff of the \"Jacket\" includes more than one hundred student editors, reporters, photographers, and videographers as well as one faculty advisor.  The Jacket's editorial board is composed of about twenty-five students who are elected by the previous year's senior editors.  The name of the paper is taken from the mascot of Berkeley High School, the Yellowjacket.  From around the mid-1950s into the early 1960s, the paper was a daily, printed by students in the school's own print shop.  Most issues at that time were one-sheets, that is, two-sided, 8\u00bd x 11\u00a0inch pages.  Friday issues were usually four pages long.  You can find the Jacket's website at bhsjacket.com"

    "question": "Bridgewater Triangle is an area where the phenomenon associated with what type of tradition has been seen? Context: Premenstrual water retention: Premenstrual water retention (or premenstrual fluid retention) is a common phenomenon associated with the menstrual cycle.  It consists of the retention of water during the period of time immediately preceding the menstrual cycle (that is, the latter half of the luteal phase, or the week before menstruation).  This water retention is most noticeable for its temporary enlargement of the breasts.  The excess fluid is lost during menstruation.  During this event, the water retention can store enough extra fluid to add an extra 5 \u2013 of weight.  The phenomenon is thought to be caused by high levels of circulating progesterone, as well as of estrogen and prolactin, stimulating secretory cells in the body and in the breasts.  In the breasts, increased blood flow is also thought to be involved.  Water retention and breast swelling can also be caused by hormonal contraceptives (which contain estrogen and/or a progestogen). Sundowning: Sundowning, or sundown syndrome, is a neurological phenomenon associated with increased confusion and restlessness in patients with delirium or some form of dementia.  Most commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, but also found in those with other forms of dementia, the term \"sundowning\" was coined due to the timing of the patient's confusion.  For patients with sundowning syndrome, a multitude of behavioral problems begin to occur in the evening or while the sun is setting.  Sundowning seems to occur more frequently during the middle stages of Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia.  Patients are generally able to understand that this behavioral pattern is abnormal.  Sundowning seems to subside with the progression of a patient's dementia.  Research shows that 20\u201345% of Alzheimer's patients will experience some sort of sundowning confusion. Thunderbird (cryptozoology): Thunderbird is a term used in cryptozoology to describe large, bird-like creatures, generally identified with the Thunderbird of Native American tradition.  Similar cryptids reported in the Old World are often called Rocs. Thunderbirds are regarded by a small number of researchers as having lizard features like the extinct pterosaurs such as \"Pteranodon\".  Reports of Thunderbird sightings go back centuries, and the fossil record does show that giant birds (teratorns) with wingspans between 12 and were likely contemporary with early man.  Today the creature is generally regarded as a myth. Patagonia picnic table effect: The Patagonia picnic table effect (also known as the Patagonia rest area effect or Patagonia rest stop effect) is a phenomenon associated with birding in which an influx of birdwatchers following the discovery of a rare bird at a location results in the discovery of further rare birds at that location, and so on, with the end result being that the locality becomes well known for rare birds, even though in itself it may be little or no better than other similar localities. Ice-marginal lava flow: An ice marginal lava flow is a phenomenon associated with glaciovolcanism.  Glaciovolcanism is the study of volcano and ice interaction, so essentially any and all volcanic activity that interacts with any sort of ice formation The science of glaciovolcanism relatively young in age because, to study it, people must overcome hostile environments.  While young, the science of glaciovolcanism can give us clues to in order to reconstruct volcanoes from the past and answer questions regarding whether or not ice was present in a certain area, the thickness of the ice, the surface elevation of the ice sheet and finally the structure of the ice sheet.  Glaciovolcanism is increasingly important for volcanic hazard awareness and preparedness, studying the Pleistocene climate record, possible relationships between deglaciation and volcanism, and finally possible Martian geoscience research. Separation (statistics): In statistics, separation is a phenomenon associated with models for dichotomous or categorical outcomes, including logistic and probit regression.  Separation occurs if the predictor (or a linear combination of some subset of the predictors) is associated with only one outcome value when the predictor is greater than some constant. Cold drop: The cold drop (Spanish: \"gota fr\u00eda\" ) is a weather phenomenon often occurring in the Spanish autumn.  It is experienced particularly along the western Mediterranean and as such, most frequently affects the east coast of Spain.  It is a closed upper-level low which has become completely displaced (cut off) from basic westerly current, and moves independently of that current.  Cutoff lows may remain nearly stationary for days, or on occasion may move westward opposite to the prevailing flow aloft (i.e., retrogression).  The term is also used to describe the meteorological phenomenon associated.  In Spain, it appears when a front of very cold polar air, a jet stream, advances slowly over Western Europe, at high altitude (normally 5\u20139\u00a0km or 3\u20135.5\u00a0mi). Bridgewater Triangle: The Bridgewater Triangle refers to an area of about 200 mi2 within southeastern Massachusetts in the United States, claimed to be a site of alleged paranormal phenomena, ranging from UFOs to poltergeists, orbs, balls of fire and other spectral phenomena, various bigfoot-like sightings, giant snakes and \"thunderbirds.\" Bennington Triangle: \"Bennington Triangle\" is a phrase coined by New England author Joseph A. Citro during a public radio broadcast in 1992 to denote an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1920 and 1950.  This was further popularized in two books, including \"Shadow Child\", in which he devoted chapters to discussion of these disappearances and various items of folklore surrounding the area.  According to Citro, the area shares characteristics with the Bridgewater Triangle in neighboring Massachusetts. Diffraction in time: Diffraction in time is a phenomenon associated with the quantum dynamics of suddenly released matter waves initially confined in a region of space."

By 1891, it was known as Fraser & Sons.  The company grew steadily during the early 20th century, but after the Second World War, a large number of acquisitions transformed the company into a national chain.  Between 1936 and 1985 over seventy companies, not including their subsidiaries, were acquired.  In 1948, the company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange, and eventually was included in the FTSE Index before the company was acquired by a consortium of investors including Baugur and Don McCarthy in 2006.  On 2 September 2014, Don McCarthy, retiring Executive Chairman of House of Fraser, announced the completion of the sale of 100% of the preferred ordinary shares and B ordinary shares, and approximately 89% of the A ordinary shares and preference shares of Highland Group Holdings Ltd, to Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co, a leading chain of Chinese department stores, for an enterprise value of approximately \u00a3480 million.

From 2005 onwards the remaining Army & Navy stores (the flagship store located on Victoria Street in London and the three others in Maidstone, Camberley, and Chichester) were refurbished and re-branded as House of Fraser stores.  House of Fraser itself was acquired by Icelandic investment company, Baugur Group, in late 2006. Arnotts (Scotland): Arnotts was a department store in Glasgow, Scotland.  Originally a subsidiary of the Dublin department store, Arnotts, it was acquired by House of Fraser and merged with neighbouring department store Robert Simpson & Sons to trade as Arnott Simpson.

House of Fraser closed its last remaining Arnotts store, that in Paisley, in January 2004. El Corte Ingl\u00e9s: El Corte Ingl\u00e9s S.A., headquartered in Madrid, is the biggest department store group in Europe and ranks fourth worldwide.  El Corte Ingl\u00e9s is Spain's only remaining department store chain, as well as owner of several associated businesses, such as: The Diamond (department store): The Diamond began in 1906 as a small shoe store in Charleston, West Virginia, founded by Roane County native Wehrle B. Geary on the belief that \"the recollection of quality remains long after price is forgotten\".  The shoe business prospered.  It moved from its original location at 215 Capitol Street and was expanded to become the city's leading shopping center by 1920.  Additional expansions followed.  In 1949, The Diamond completed a $1,250,000 expansion and modernization project which included five elevators and a set of escalators that reached from the basement \"Budget Store\" to the fifth floor.  The Diamond eventually became West Virginia's largest department store with 180000 sqft of space.  The fifth-floor cafeteria was a destination for businessmen and shoppers alike.  The store was acquired by Associated Dry Goods in 1956.  During the 1970s, Hickory Farms had a location in a portion of the basement of the store.  The Diamond opened its one and only branch location at Grand Central Mall, Vienna, WV in 1972.  Associated sold off the stores in 1983 because of limited expansion room.  Near the beginning of the 21st century, the state of West Virginia purchased the former department store and transformed it into state offices.  The original facade of the downtown store (on the corner of Capitol and Washington Streets) remains largely unchanged."

    "question": "In Ancient Egyptian religion how would a citizen be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire ? Context: Ancient Egyptian religion: Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society.  It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature.  Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.  He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe.  The state dedicated enormous resources to Egyptian rituals and to the construction of the temples. Hatmehit: Hatmehit, or Hatmehyt (reconstructed to have been pronounced *H\u0101wit-Ma\u1e25\u016byat in Egyptian) in the ancient Egyptian religion was a fish-goddess in the area around the delta city of Per-banebdjedet, Mendes.  In ancient Egyptian art Hatmehit was depicted either as a fish, or a woman with a fish emblem or crown on her head.  She was a goddess of life and protection. Ra: Ra ( ; Egyptian: \"r\ua725\" or \"r\u02e4;\" also transliterated \"r\u02e4w;\" cuneiform: \ud808\ude91\ud808\udc00 \"ri-a\" or \ud808\ude91\ud808\udd40 \"ri-ia\") or Re ( ; <a href=\"Coptic%20language\">Coptic</a>: , \"R\u0113\") is the <a href=\"ancient%20Egyptian%20religion\">ancient Egyptian</a> <a href=\"sun%20god\">sun god</a>.  By the Fifth Dynasty in the 25th and 24th\u00a0centuries\u00a0, he had become a major god in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun. Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory: Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory is a soccer video game based on the FIFA World Cup 1998, despite being released after the 1998 FIFA World Cup.  It features 73 teams' countries.  Each team enters a \"Regional Qualifying Round Final\" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification.  For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group.  Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs.  If the player beats the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup.  In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group.  For example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea.  It is a re-make of \"Super Sidekicks 3\".  However, animations and designs were exactly the same.  The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers).  Its slogan is \"We got the kick\". Osiris myth: The Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology.  It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences.  Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne.  Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her.  The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne.  Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.  The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife.  It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth. Ancient Egyptian offering formula: The Ancient Egyptian offering formula, generally referred to as the \u1e25tp-d\u1ec9-nsw formula by Egyptologists, was written as an offering for the deceased in the ancient Egyptian religion.  The offering formula was believed to allow the deceased to partake in offerings presented to the major deities in the name of the king, or in offerings presented directly to the deceased by family members.  All ancient Egyptian offering formulas share the same basic structure, but there is a great deal of variety in which deities and offerings are mentioned, and which epithets and titles are used.  Below is an example of a typical offering formula: Pyramid Texts: The Pyramid Texts are a collection of ancient Egyptian religious texts from the time of the Old Kingdom.  Written in Old Egyptian, the pyramid texts were carved on the walls and sarcophagi of the pyramids at Saqqara during the 5th and 6th Dynasties of the Old Kingdom.  The oldest of the texts have been dated to between ca. 2400\u20132300 BC.  Unlike the later Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead, the pyramid texts were reserved only for the pharaoh and were not illustrated.  Following the earlier Palermo Stone, the pyramid texts mark the next-oldest known mention of Osiris, who would become the most important deity associated with afterlife in the Ancient Egyptian religion. Damnation: Damnation (from Latin \"damnatis\") is the concept of divine punishment and torment in an afterlife for actions that were committed on Earth.  In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth.  If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire.  Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal.  Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin .  A damned human \"in damnation\" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor.  In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned. Traditional Berber religion: The traditional Berber religion is the ancient and native set of beliefs and deities adhered to by the Berber autochthones of North Africa.  Many ancient Berber beliefs were developed locally whereas others were influenced over time through contact with other traditional African religions (such as the Ancient Egyptian religion), or borrowed during antiquity from the Punic religion, Judaism, Iberian mythology, and the Hellenistic religion.  The most recent influence came from Islam and pre-Islamic Arab religion during the medieval period.  Some of the ancient Berber beliefs still exist today subtly within the Berber popular culture and tradition. Ancient Egyptian deities: Ancient Egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt.  The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory.  Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to \"maat\", or divine order.  After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100\u00a0BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out."

The liner notes state that Rock re-recorded the songs from \"Polyfuze\" because he could not find the master recordings, and \"remixed and touched up\" the \"EMSP\" tracks to show how they would have sounded if Rock had the money to record them properly at the time.  There are also three previously unreleased songs from those album sessions (\"Born 2 B A Hick\" from the \"Polyfuze\" sessions in 1992, \"Dark and Grey\" and \"Abortion\" from the \"EMSP\" sessions in 1994).  The only new tracks were \"American Bad Ass\", which was the first single from the album, and \"Fuck That\", which had been used previously for the \"Any Given Sunday\" soundtrack.  \"Fuck U Blind\" was re-written from the original version and was more funk than the original rap metal version.  Foreshadowing his move out of hip hop, he remade both \"Prodigal Son\" and \"My Oedipus Complex\" as southern rock songs.  Even though they were recorded in 1992, \"Born 2 B A Hick\" was a rockabilly song and \"Abortion\" was a dark blues ballad. Mich\u00e8le Roberts: Mich\u00e8le Brigitte Roberts (born 20 May 1949) is a British writer, novelist and poet.  She is the daughter of a French Catholic teacher mother (Monique Caulle) and English Protestant father (Reginald Roberts), and has dual UK\u2013France nationality.

As a tribute to his transatlantic love affair with England, his obituary was printed in UK's \"The Daily Telegraph\". What's So Amazing About Grace?: What's So Amazing About Grace?  is a 1997 book by Philip Yancey, an American journalist and editor-at-large for \"Christianity Today\".  The book examines grace in Christianity, contending that people crave grace and that it is central to the gospel, but that many local churches ignore grace and instead seek to exterminate immorality.  \"What's So Amazing About Grace?\"  includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life, accounts of historical events and other stories.  These include a modern retelling of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, an account of Yancey's friendship with Mel White who came out as homosexual, a comparison of the teachings of early Christians Pelagius and Augustine of Hippo, and a summary of Karen Blixen's short story \"Babette's Feast\". Eloy Urroz: Eloy Urroz is a Mexican writer and Professor of Spanish and Latin American Literature at The Citadel in South Carolina.  Though born in New York, Urroz grew up in Mexico City and is of Mexican nationality.

Urroz has written eight novels, four books on literary criticism, four books of poetry, three political reportages and dozens of essays, articles, and reviews on Latin American and Peninsular Culture and Literature.  Some of his novels have been translated into English, French, Italian, Portuguese, and German.  In the United States, his novels are published by Dalkey Archive Press. Jeffrey Archer: Jeffrey Howard Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare (born 15 April 1940) is an English novelist and politician. Ezekiel 16: Ezekiel 16 is the sixteenth chapter of the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.  This book contains the prophecies spoken by the prophet Ezekiel, and is a part of the Books of the Prophets.  Clements calls this chapter \"an Old Testament parable of the prodigal daughter\", describing a shocking illustration eof ungrateful Jerusalem in contrast to God's enduring love to her.  This chapter is often linked to Ezekiel 23 which deals with two daughters, symbolizing the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah."

    "question": "The alcoholic drink that shares a name with Quintessentially Unreal's 1996 album is commonly reffered to in historical literature as what? Context: List of alcoholic drinks: This is a list of alcoholic drinks.  An alcoholic drink is a drink that contains ethanol, commonly known as alcohol.  Alcoholic drinks are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and distilled beverages.  They are legally consumed in most countries, and over one hundred countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption.  In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them.  This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink.  Most nations set it at 18 years of age. Arak (drink): Arak or araq (Arabic: \u0639\u0631\u0642\u200e \u200e ) is a Levantine alcoholic spirit (~40\u201363% Alc.  Vol. /~80\u2013126 proof, commonly 50% Alc.  Vol. /100 proof) in the anis drinks family.  It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink.  The Persian (Iranian) version of Arak (commonly called Arak Saggi) does not contain anise, as it is usually produced from \u200craisins, dates or saccharum plant.  Arak is the traditional alcoholic beverage in the Arab world, especially in the Levant/Mashriq and also in the Maghreb, as well in Iran and Turkey. Marskin ryyppy: Marskin ryyppy (lit.  \"The Marshal's drink/shot\"; Swedish: \"Marskens snaps\" ) is a strong alcoholic drink of Finnish origin, served as a schnapps.  The drink is named after Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, the Marshal of Finland.  According to all sources it is important that the glass where the drink is served is poured as full as possible (to the point where surface tension keeps some of the drink in the glass); the glass is then to be emptied without spilling.  This practice is said to originate in the Chevalier Guard where Mannerheim once served; every man was entitled one shot of Vodka per day, and through this practice everyone was assured the equal maximum amount.  Marskin ryyppy must also be served ice-cold. Zurracapote: Zurracapote (sometimes abbreviated as zurra) is a popular Spanish alcoholic mixed drink, similar to sangr\u00eda.  It consists of red wine mixed with fruit such as peaches and lemons, sugar, and cinnamon.  The concoction is then traditionally left to steep for several days, though some recipes call for the addition of other alcoholic beverages, juices, and fruit extracts.  The result is a mild-to-medium alcoholic drink, similar to sangr\u00eda. Cundill Prize: The Cundill Prize in Historical Literature (or simply Cundill Prize) was founded in 2008 by Peter Cundill to recognize and promote literary and academic achievement in history.  The prize is presented annually to an author who has published a non-fiction book in the prior year that is likely to have profound literary, social, and academic impact in the area of history.  At a value of $75,000 U.S., the Grand Prize is claimed to be the richest non-fiction historical literature prize in the world.  In addition, two \"Recognition of Excellence\" prizes of $10,000 U.S. each are awarded.  The winners of the Prizes are selected by an independent jury of at least five internationally qualified individuals selected by McGill University.  The Cundill Prize in History at McGill is administered by McGill University's Dean of Arts, with the help of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada (MISC). Quintessentially Unreal: Quintessentially Unreal is the debut album by American Neo-Cabaret artist Jill Tracy, released in 1996.  It was nominated for California Music Awards in 1997 and 1998.  Selections from the album were used on an NBC Hard Copy segment on Absinthe. Caffeinated alcoholic drink: A caffeinated alcoholic drink, or caffeinated alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains both alcohol (also known formally as ethanol) and caffeine.  They often include the ingredients of energy drinks as well.  In 2010 and 2011, this type of beverage faced criticism for posing health risks to their drinkers.  In some places there is a ban on caffeinated alcoholic beverages. Rak\u0131: Rak\u0131 is an unsweetened, occasionally (depending on area of production) anise-flavored, alcoholic drink that is popular in Albania, Turkey, Greece (where it is distinctly different and comes as an unflavoured distillate, unlike its Turkish counterpart), Iran, Turkic countries, and in the Balkan countries as an ap\u00e9ritif.  It is often served with seafood or meze.  It is similar to several other alcoholic beverages available around the Mediterranean and the Middle East, e.g. pastis, ouzo, sambuca, arak, Aragh Sagi and aguardiente.  In Turkey and Greece, it is considered a national drink. Tempore: Tempore (abbreviated to temp.)  in historical literature denotes a period during which a person whose exact lifespan is unknown was known to have been alive or active, or some other date which is not exactly known, usually given as the reign of a monarch.  The word is Latin, being the ablative singular of the noun \"tempus, temporis\", \"time\", thus meaning \"in the time (of)\".  It should be followed by a name in the genitive case.  The theoretical full form might be \"vixit tempore Regis Henrici Primi\" (\"he/she lived in the time of King Henry the First\") (i.e. 1100-1135).  The best known occurrence is in the Domesday Book of 1086, where the phrase \"Tempore Regis Eduardi\" (nominative case \"Rex Eduardus\"), meaning \"in the time of King Edward (the Confessor)\" appears in the entry for almost every manor, abbreviated as TRE.  It thus signifies the date range 1042\u20131066.  It is useful in historical literature because the names of many historical persons appear in surviving documents only in royal charters, possibly as witnesses, which can be dated to the reign of the originating monarch. Absinthe: Absinthe ( or ; French: ] ) is historically described as a distilled, highly alcoholic (45\u201374% ABV / 90\u2013148 U.S. proof) beverage.  It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of \"Artemisia absinthium\" (\"grand wormwood\"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless.  It is commonly referred to in historical literature as \"\"la f\u00e9e verte \"\" (the green fairy).  Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit.  Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed."

Broadway Rose Theatre Company: In 1991, seven years after meeting in a summer stock production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania, Dan Murphy and Sharon Maroney (married), along with fellow performer Matthew Ryan (a native of Tigard, OR) and his partner Joseph Morkys, decided to move from New York City to start a summer stock theatre in Tigard.  The team pooled their savings of $21,000 and in November 1991, Broadway Rose Theatre Company was incorporated as a 501(c)(3).  In the summer of 1992, the first season of Broadway Rose Theatre Company was performed at the Deb Fennell Auditorium at Tigard High School.  The company produced five mainstage shows and a children's show in eight weeks, with an average audience of 32 people per performance.  The company lost $8,700 in its first season, but the following year the fledgling company received a $3,000 grant from the Metropolitan Arts Commission (a forerunner of the Regional Arts & Culture Council), to help bring the organization out of debt.  In 1993, the company produced \"Oklahoma! \" with no funds\u2014putting the entire payroll on Dan's personal credit card.  The situation resolved itself as audiences picked up.  In 1994, the company received a $4,000 grant from the Metropolitan Arts Commission.  Audiences averaged 132 people per performance that year\u2014a 313 percent increase from 1992.  In 1995, The Collins Foundation provided the company a $5,000 grant, allowing Sharon Maroney to become the company's first paid employee.  Platt Electric Supply became Broadway Rose's first title sponsor in 1996, providing a new level of stable funding (they would stay on as a title sponsor through 2012 when Harvey Platt sold the company).  In 1997, co-founders Matthew Ryan and Joe Morkys left Broadway Rose and returned to New York.  That year Broadway Rose held its first drama camp for young performers aged 8\u201311.  Also in 1997, Shoshana Bean, who would later become famous for portraying Elphaba on Broadway in the musical \"Wicked\"\",\" starred in the Broadway Rose production of \"Bye Bye Birdie.\"  The company's offices moved from Dan and Sharon's home to a Platt Electric Supply branch office in 1999.  Later that year, the Sherwood Arts Council contracted Broadway Rose to produce \"Broadway Goes Hollywood\", a fundraiser for SAC held at the historic Robin Hood Theater in Sherwood, OR.  Broadway Rose's annual budget rose to around $175,000 with ticket sales accounting for just under half of the total, and Dan's general manager position officially became funded, making him an employee rather than a volunteer. Destined to be Yours: Destined to be Yours is a 2017 Philippine romantic-comedy and drama television series broadcast by GMA Network and created by GMA Entertainment TV.  It premiered on February 27, 2017 replacing the first season of \"Alyas Robin Hood\" on the GMA Telebabad block and worldwide via GMA Pinoy TV.

    "question": "Which year was the more recent engine series, the Honda K or Honda H, introduced? Context: Honda B engine: The B-series are a family of inline four-cylinder DOHC/SOHC automotive engines introduced by Honda in 1989.  Sold concurrently with the D-series which were primarily SOHC engines designed for more economical applications, the B-series were aimed more as a performance option featuring dual and single-overhead cams along with the first application of Honda's VTEC system (available in some models).  To identify a Honda B-series engine, the letter B is normally followed by two numbers to designate the displacement of the engine, another letter, and in US-spec engines, another number.  The Japanese spec-engines are normally designated with a four character alphanumeric designation.  The B-series, the B20B variant in particular, is not to be confused with the earlier Honda B20A engine introduced in 1985 and primarily available in the Prelude and Accord-derived vehicles from 1985-1991.  While sharing some design elements and both being multivalve Honda four-cylinders, the B-series and B20A differ substantially in architecture, enough to be considered distinct engine families. Toyota E engine: The Toyota E engine family is a straight-4 piston engine series, and uses timing belt rather than a chain.  The E engines were the first multi-valve engines from Toyota designed with economy, practicality and everyday use in mind (rather than performance).  Like many other Toyota engines from the era, the E engine series features a cast iron block, along with an aluminum cylinder head.  E engines are lighter compared to earlier Toyota engines, due the hollow crankshaft, thinned casting of the cylinder block, and several other reductions in auxiliaries as well as in the engine itself.  Carbureted versions include a newly designed, variable-venturi carburetor.  All of these changes improved economy and emissions.  The members of the E engine family, range from 1.0\u00a0L to 1.5\u00a0L.  The E family supplanted the \"K\" engines in most applications.  A large number of parts in the E engine series are interchangeable between each other. Honda K engine: The Honda K series engine is a four-cylinder four-stroke engine introduced in 2001.  The K series engines are equipped with DOHC valvetrains and use roller rockers to reduce friction.  The engines use a coil-on-plug, distributorless ignition system with a coil for each spark plug.  This system forgoes the use of a conventional distributor-based ignition timing system in favor of a computer-controlled system that allows the ECU to control ignition timings based on various sensor inputs.  The cylinders have cast iron sleeves similar to the B-series & F-series engines, as opposed to the FRM cylinders found in the H-series and newer F series engines found only in the Honda S2000. CVCC: CVCC is a trademark by the Honda Motor Company for an engine with reduced automotive emissions, which stood for \"Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion\".  The first mention of Honda developed CVCC technology was done by Mr. Soichiro Honda February 12, 1971, at the Federation of Economic Organizations Hall in Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo.  Honda's engineers at the time, Mr. Date conferred with Mr. Yagi and Mr. Nakagawa about the possibility of creating lean combustion via a prechamber, which some diesel engines utilized.  The first engine to be installed with the CVCC approach for testing was the single-cylinder, 300 cc Honda EA engine used in the Honda N600 hatchback in January 1970.  This technology allowed Honda's cars to meet Japanese and United States emission standards in the 1970s without a catalytic converter.  A type of stratified charge engine, it first appeared on the 1975 \"ED1\" engine.  As emission laws advanced and required more stringent admissible levels, Honda abandoned the CVCC method and introduced PGM-FI, or Programmed Fuel Injection on all Honda vehicles.  Some vehicles in Japan had a combination of electronically controlled carburetors, called PGM-Carb on specific, transitional Honda D, E and ZC engines. Honda Mobilio: Honda Mobilio (Japanese: \u30db\u30f3\u30c0\u30e2\u30d3\u30ea\u30aa , Honda Mobirio ) is a seven-seater mini MPV produced by Japanese automaker Honda.  The first generation Mobilio produced from 2001 to 2008, was the second in Honda's Small Max series and also took Honda's Global Small Platform and their i-DSI engine.  In May 2008, Honda Freed was introduced, replacing the Mobilio.  The second generation Mobilio was introduced in Indonesia in early 2014, then into the Indian market in July 2014.  The Mobilio was also introduced into the South African market in October 2014. Honda H Engine: The Honda H engine was Honda's Larger high-performance engine family from the 1990s and early 2000s.  It is largely derived from the Honda F engine with which it shares many design features.  Like Honda's other 4-cylinder families of the 80s and 90s, It has also enjoyed some success as a racing engine, forming the basis of Honda's Touring car racing engines for many years, and being installed in lightweight chassis (such as the Honda CRX) for use in drag racing.  The F20B is technically coded as part of the F-series family of engines; it is basically a destroked version of the H22A.  It was developed by Honda to be able to enter into the 2-liter class of international racing. Honda Capa: The Honda Capa, with the Honda series code GA4 and GA6, is a supermini MPV five-door hatchback produced by Honda between 1998 and 2002.  It was introduced at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show as the concept car \"J-MW.\"  It was introduced for retail sale April 24, 1998.  The only engine the Capa had was the 98\u00a0hp 1.5L Honda engine, the D15B, with either a 4-speed automatic transmission (front-wheel drive only) or a CVT called \"Multimatic S\".  September 16, 1999 a 4WD version of the Capa was released, using Honda's Full-Time four-wheel-drive system.  Brake Assist was offered as standard equipment.  Due to disappointing sales the Capa, short for \"capacity\", it was discontinued and replaced by the Honda Mobilio and Honda Fit.  It was sold in Japan at two Honda dealership sales channels \"Honda Primo\", and \"Honda Verno\".

The first power station built on the site was known as Dunston A Power Station, and the second, which gradually replaced it between 1933 and 1950, was known as Dunston B Power Station.  The A Station was, in its time, one of the largest in the country, and as well as burning coal had early open cycle gas turbine units.  The B Station was the first of a new power station design, and stood as a landmark in the Tyne for over 50\u00a0years.  From the A Station's opening in 1910 until the B Station's demolition in 1986, they collectively operated from the early days of electricity generation in the United Kingdom, through the industry's nationalisation, and until a decade before its privatisation."

Context: Scaevola coriacea: Scaevola coriacea, the dwarf naupaka, is a species of flowering plant in the \"Goodenia\" family, Goodeniaceae, that is endemic to Hawaii. Scaevola oxyclona: Scaevola oxyclona, commonly known as Tangled Fanflower, is a spiny shrub in the family Goodeniaceae, native to Western Australia.  It grows to between 0.1 and 1.5\u00a0metres high and produces blue to purple flowers from August to December in its native range.  The species was formally described by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in the tenth volume of \"Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae\" based on plant material collected at Frasers Range and Mount Benjamin. Scaevola albida: Scaevola albida, known by the common name of White Fan-flower, is a prostrate shrub found growing \"from south-eastern Queensland through eastern New South Wales and coastal areas of Victoria and Tasmania in a range of habitats\".  Unlike most other species of \"Scaevola\" which grow into a bush, \"Scaevola albida\" is a ground cover, forming a mat on the ground around 30-40 centimetres across.  Its leaves are bright green, semi-succulent and slightly hairy.  They are of an elliptical shape with wavy edges. Scaevola hookeri: Scaevola hookeri, the creeping fan-flower or alpine fan-flower, is a prostrate perennial herb in the family Goodeniaceae.  It is native to eastern Australia.  Leaves are 6 to 50 mm long and 2 to 15 mm wide.  Flowers are white or blue with a yellowish throat and appear between December and March in the species native range.  The species was first formally described by W.H. de Vriese in 1850 in \"Nederlandsch Kruidkundig Archief\" and given the name \"Merkusia hookeri\".  The species was transferred to the genus \"Scaevola\" in 1856.  It occurs in grassland and woodland in high altitude areas in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, and also South Australia where it is listed as \"endangered\". Scaevola (plant): Scaevola is a genus of flowering plants in the \"Goodenia\" family, Goodeniaceae.  It consists of more than 130 tropical species, with the center of diversity being Australia and Polynesia. Goodeniaceae: Goodeniaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Asterales.  It contains about 404 species in twelve genera.  The family is distributed mostly in Australia, except for the genus \"Scaevola\", which is pantropical.  Its species are found across most of Australia, being especially common in arid and semi-arid climates. Sonerila janakiana: Sonerila janakiana is a species of plant in the Melastomataceae family.  It is a tuberous, scapigerous and stoloniferous plant species. Sesbania tomentosa: Sesbania tomentosa, commonly known as Oahu riverhemp and \u02bb \u014chai, is an endangered species of flowering plant in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is endemic to the main Hawaiian Islands as well as Nihoa and Necker Island.  It inhabits low shrublands and, rarely, dry forests, at elevations from sea level to 2500 ft .  Associated native plant species include aki\u02bb aki (\"Sporobolus virginicus\"), ilima (\"Sida fallax\"), naupaka kahakai (\"Scaevola taccada\"), and pili (\"Heteropogon contortus\").  Off-road vehicles, wildfires, grazing, and alien species competition have destroyed their habitat on the main islands, but they are still quite common on Nihoa and Necker.  At least 2000 specimens grow on Nihoa, while there are far less on Necker. List of Scaevola species: This is a list of \"Scaevola\" species. Sonerila: The genus Sonerila Roxb.  belongs to family Melastomaceae.

Historically, radicalism has referred exclusively to the radical left (under the single category of far-left politics) and rarely incorporating far-right politics - though these may have revolutionary elements; the prominent exception is in the United States where some consider radicalism to include both political extremes of the radical left and the radical right.  In traditional labels of the spectrum of political thought, the opposite of radical on the \"right\" of the political spectrum is termed \"reactionary\". Committee for a Radical Left Rally: ERAS (Committee for a Radical Left Rally, \"\u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03a1\u03b9\u03b6\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ae \u03a3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\") was a far-left organisation in the Republic of Cyprus.

    "question": "What other film did the star of 127 Hours act in? Context: Aron Ralston: Aron Lee Ralston (born October 27, 1975) is an American outdoorsman, mechanical engineer and motivational speaker known for having survived a canyoneering accident in southeastern Utah in 2003 during which he amputated his own right forearm with a dull pocketknife in order to extricate himself from a dislodged boulder, which had him trapped in Blue John Canyon for five days and seven hours (127 hours).  After he freed himself, he had to make his way through the remainder of the canyon, then rappel down a 65 feet sheer cliff face in order to reach safety. Factories Act 1847: The Factory Act of 1847, also known as the Ten Hours Act was a United Kingdom Act of Parliament which restricted the working hours of women and young persons (13-18) in textile mills to 10 hours per day.  The practicalities of running a textile mill were such that the Act should have effectively set the same limit on the working hours of adult male mill-workers, but defective drafting meant that a subsequent Factory Act in 1850 imposing tighter restrictions on the hours within which women and young persons could work was needed to bring this about.  With this slight qualification, the Act of 1847 was the culmination of a campaign lasting almost fifteen years to bring in a 'Ten Hours Bill'; a great Radical cause of the period .  Richard Oastler was a prominent and early advocate; the most famous Parliamentarian involved was Lord Ashley who campaigned long and tirelessly on the issue (although he was not an MP in the session when the Act was passed), but the eventual success owed much to the mobilisation of support among the mill-workers by organisers such as John Doherty and sympathetic mill-owners such as John Fielden, MP who piloted the Act through the Commons.  The 1847 Act was passed soon after the fall from power of Sir Robert Peel's Conservative government, but the fiercest opponents of all ten-hour bills were the 'free trade' Liberals such as John Bright; the economic doctrines that led them to object to artificial tariff barriers also led them to object to government restricting the terms on which a man might sell his labour, and to extend that objection to women and young persons. 127 Hours: 127 Hours is a 2010 biographical survival found footage drama film directed, co-written, and produced by Danny Boyle.

Context: Archdeaconry of St Andrews: The Archdeaconry of St Andrews was a sub-division of the diocese of St Andrews, one of two archdeaconries within the diocese.  The St Andrews archdeaconry was headed by the Archdeacon of St Andrews, a subordinate of the Bishop of St Andrews.  In the medieval period, the Archdeaconry of St Andrews contained five deaneries with a total of 124 parish churches.  The deaneries were Mearns (14 churches), Angus (38 churches), Gowrie (20 churches), Fife (28 churches) and Fothriff (24 churches). St Dionis Backchurch: St Dionis Backchurch was a parish church in the Langbourn ward of the City of London.  Of medieval origin, it was rebuilt after the Great Fire of London to the designs of Christopher Wren and demolished in 1878. Great Fire of London: The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of the English city of London from Sunday, 2 September to Wednesday, 5 September 1666.  The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall.  It threatened but did not reach the aristocratic district of Westminster, Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums.  It consumed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities.  It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants. St Mary's Church, Acton: St Mary's Church is an active Anglican parish church located in Monk's Lane, Acton, a village to the west of Nantwich, Cheshire, England.  Since 1967 it has been designated a Grade\u00a0I listed building.  A church has been present on this site since before the time of the Domesday Survey.  The tower is the oldest in Cheshire, although it had to be largely rebuilt after it fell in 1757.  One unusual feature of the interior of the church is that the old stone seating around its sides has been retained.  In the south aisle are some ancient carved stones dating back to the Norman era.  The architectural historian Alec Clifton-Taylor includes the church in his list of 'best' English parish churches.  In the churchyard is a tall 17th-century sundial.

Minster (church): Minster is an honorific title given to particular churches in England, most famously York Minster in York, Westminster in London and Southwell Minster in Southwell.  The term \"minster\" is first found in royal foundation charters of the 7th century.  Although it corresponds to the Latin \"monasterium\" or monastery, it then designated any settlement of clergy living a communal life and endowed by charter with the obligation of maintaining the daily office of prayer.  Widespread in 10th-century Anglo-Saxon England, minsters declined in importance with the systematic introduction of parishes and parish churches from the 11th century onwards.  It continued as a title of dignity in later medieval England, for instances where a cathedral, monastery, collegiate church or parish church had originated with an Anglo-Saxon foundation.  Eventually a minster came to refer more generally to \"any large or important church, especially a collegiate or cathedral church\".  In the 21st century, the Church of England has designated additional minsters by bestowing the status on existing parish churches. The Iron Church: The Iron Church or The Cast Iron Church is a term which has been used to refer to any of the three churches built in Liverpool in the early 19th century by John Cragg, who ran the Mersey Iron Foundry.  The churches incorporated substantial cast iron elements into their structure and decoration.  Two of these churches are still in existence and are active Anglican parish churches.

Thomas Graham Jackson: Sir Thomas Graham Jackson, 1st Baronet {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (21 December 1835 \u2013 7 November 1924) was one of the most distinguished English architects of his generation.

Much of his career was devoted to the architecture of education and he worked extensively for various schools, notably Giggleswick and his own alma mater Brighton College.  Jackson designed the former town hall in Tipperary Town, Ireland.  He also worked on many parish churches and the college chapel at the University of Wales, Lampeter.

He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by.  Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him.  Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar.  Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of \"Rolling Stone\") citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of \"PopMatters\") indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements."

    "question": "In regards to Value premium an expert argued that no value premium exisits, what did this expert found? Context: Variable universal life insurance: Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value.  In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner.  The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary\u2014they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets.  The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments.  The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance.  This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium). Option time value: In finance, the time value (TV) (\"extrinsic\" or \"instrumental\" value) of an option is the premium a rational investor would pay over its \"current\" exercise value (intrinsic value), based on the probability it will increase in value before expiry.  For an American option this value is always greater than zero in a fair market, thus an option is \"always\" worth more than its current exercise value. .  As an option can be thought of as 'price insurance' (e.g., an airline insuring against unexpected soaring fuel costs caused by a hurricane), TV can be thought of as the \"risk premium\" the option seller charges the buyer\u2014the higher the expected risk (volatility formula_1 time), the higher the premium.  Conversely, TV can be thought of as the price an investor is willing to pay for potential upside. Sunday Mattress: Sunday is a sleep focussed start-up in India founded by Alphonse Reddy, \u2013 who is also the founder of Fabmart.com, a retail venture that sells premium sleep products \u2013 in September 2015.  Sunday mattresses are manufactured and retailed by MRPL (Madanapalle Retail Private Ltd).  Sunday sources its raw materials from four different countries, including Belgium.  The mattresses have been designed by Japanese designer Hiroko Shiratori, who is the founding member of London based design collective OKAY studio.  Apart from selling online through its website, the company also retails in Bangalore.  The company sells two mattress variants \u2014 Ortho plus and Latex Plus, and follows omni-channel sales strategy.  Its online sales are augmented by an experience centre in Bangalore.  Sunday like other sleep start-ups follows a 100 Nights Trial offer, where customers can return the product and get a full refund if they are not satisfied with the purchase.  The product range includes mattresses, pillows, toppers and protector pads.  Sunday offers value additions such as same day delivery & Try\u2019N\u2019Pay in Bangalore and Hyderabad.  Sunday mattress is one of the best options in the mid and premium range.  Sunday is funded by Anand Morzaria, entrepreneur in the ITES space, and his team. List of Burger King products: When the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1955, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts.  After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper.  The company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the Big King sandwich in 1996 in response to McDonald's Big Mac sandwich.  The company began experimenting with premium hamburgers, made from higher quality ingredients, in 1978 with the introduction of its Specialty Sandwich product line.  The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product.  However, it wasn't until 2002 when the company began to work on a premium burger in earnest.  On the value side, Burger King first started offering sliders to its menu in the mid-1980s and offered them off and on for the next twenty years. John C. Bogle: John Clifton \"Jack\" Bogle (born May 8, 1929) is an American investor, business magnate, and philanthropist.  He is the founder and retired chief executive of The Vanguard Group. Forward premium anomaly: The forward premium anomaly in currency markets (also referred to as the forward premium puzzle or the Fama puzzle) refers to the well documented empirical finding that the domestic currency is expected to appreciate when domestic nominal interest rates exceed foreign interest rates.  This is puzzling because economic theory suggests that if all currencies are equally risky investors would demand higher interest rates on currencies expected to \"fall\" in value.  See: Forward exchange rate# Unbiasedness hypothesis. Minority discount: Minority discount is an economic concept reflecting the notion that a partial ownership interest may be worth less than its proportional share of the total business.  The concept applies to equities with voting power because the size of voting position provides additional benefits or drawbacks.  For example, ownership of a 51% share in the business is usually worth more than 51% of its equity value\u2014this phenomenon is called the premium for control.  Conversely, ownership of a 30% share in the business may be worth less than 30% of its equity value.  This is so because this minority ownership limits the scope of control over critical aspects of the business.  Share prices of public companies usually reflect the minority discount.  This is why take-private transactions involve a substantial premium over recently quoted prices. Universal life insurance: Universal life insurance (often shortened to UL) is a type of cash value life insurance, sold primarily in the United States of America.  Under the terms of the policy, the excess of premium payments above the current cost of insurance is credited to the cash value of the policy.  The cash value is credited each month with interest, and the policy is debited each month by a cost of insurance (COI) charge, as well as any other policy charges and fees drawn from the cash value, even if no premium payment is made that month.  Interest credited to the account is determined by the insurer, but has a contractual minimum rate (often 2%).  When an earnings rate is pegged to a financial index such as a stock, bond or other interest rate index, the policy is an \"Indexed Universal Life\" contract.  These types of policies offer the advantage of guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at substantially lower premium cost than an equivalent whole life policy at first; the cost of insurance is always increasing as found on the cost index table (usually p. 3 of a contract).  This not only allows for easy comparison of costs between carriers, but also works well in irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILIT's) since cash is of no consequence. Value premium: In investing, value premium refers to the greater risk-adjusted return of value stocks over growth stocks.  Eugene Fama and K. G. French first identified the premium in 1992, using a measure they called HML (high book-to-market ratio minus low book-to-market ratio) to measure equity returns based on valuation.  Other experts, such as John C. Bogle, have argued that no value premium exists, claiming that Fama and French's research is period dependent. Tesco Venture Brands: Tesco venture brands are an advanced form of private label brands launched by Tesco in 2011 that do not carry the retailer name.  These products fall under the category of Tesco venture brands and complement their current value, standard and finest ranges.  Tesco venture branded goods are available in a wide range of industries from food to children's toys to sanitary products.  Most of the brands are positioned as \"premium goods\" competing with existing premium branded goods."

    "question": "What was the official religion of the lands of the husband of Dorothea of Denmark, Duchess of Prussia? Context: Irreligion in Mexico: Irreligion in Mexico refers to atheism, deism, religious skepticism, secularism, and secular humanism in Mexican society, which was a confessional state after independence from Imperial Spain.  The first political constitution of the Mexican United States enacted in 1824, stipulated that Roman Catholicism was the national religion in perpetuity, and prohibited any other religion.  Moreover, since 1857, by law, Mexico has had no official religion; as such, anti-clerical laws meant to promote a secular society, contained in the 1857 Constitution of Mexico and in the 1917 Constitution of Mexico limited the participation in civil life of Roman Catholic organizations, and allowed government intervention to religious participation in politics. Albert, Duke of Prussia: Albert of Prussia (German: Albrecht von Preussen, 17 May 149020 March 1568) was the 37th Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, who after converting to Lutheranism, became the first ruler of the Duchy of Prussia, the secularized state that emerged from the former Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights.  Albert was the first European ruler to establish Lutheranism, and thus Protestantism, as the official state religion of his lands.  He proved instrumental in the political spread of Protestantism in its early stage, ruling the Prussian lands for nearly six decades (1510\u20131568). Dorothea of Denmark, Duchess of Prussia: Dorothea of Denmark (1 August 1504\u201311 April 1547), was a Danish princess and Duchess of Prussia.  She was the daughter of King Frederick I of Denmark and Anna of Brandenburg.  She was married to Duke Albert, Duke of Prussia. Religion in Abkhazia: Many inhabitants of Abkhazia are Orthodox Christians, with a significant minority adhering to Islam and a growing population adopting Abkhaz neopaganism, or the \"Abkhazian traditional religion\".  The influence of this last has always remained strong and has been experiencing a revival through the 1990s and 2000s.  By 2016, Abkhaz traditional religion, whose priesthood was institutionalized in 2012, supported and administered by the government of Abkhazia that has contributed to the restoration of tens of sanctuaries, has come to \"dominate and prevail\" over both Christianity and Islam, and it is likely that it will be proclaimed the official religion of the state in the near future. Freedom of religion in Iran: Freedom of religion in Iran is marked by Iranian culture, major religion and politics.  Iran is officially and in practice an Islamic republic\u2014the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran mandates that the official religion of Iran is Shia Islam and the Twelver Ja'fari school, and also mandates that other Islamic schools are to be accorded full respect, and their followers are free to act in accordance with their own jurisprudence in performing their religious rites.  Iran recognizes Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian religious minorities, among others.  The continuous presence of the country's pre-Islamic, non-Muslim communities, such as Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, had accustomed the population to the participation of non-Muslims in society.  However, despite official recognition of such minorities by Iran's government, the actions of the government create a \"threatening atmosphere for some religious minorities\". Marapu: The Marapu religion (also known as Marafu in Sumba) is a form of ancestral religion that is practiced mainly in the island of Sumba in Indonesia.  Marapu is also practiced in many more remote areas of Sumba and Flores.  Both the Christians and Muslims on these islands tend to combine their faiths with Marapu.  Since Marapu, like Kaharingan of the Dayaks, is not an official religion of Indonesia, and all Indonesian citizens are required to identify as of one of a member of the sanctioned religions by law, members have chosen either Christianity or Islam to self identify. List of monarchs of Prussia: The monarchs of Prussia were members of the House of Hohenzollern who were the hereditary rulers of the former German state of Prussia from its founding in 1525 as the Duchy of Prussia.  The Duchy had evolved out of the Teutonic Order, a Roman Catholic crusader state and theocracy located along the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea.  The Teutonic Knights were under the leadership of a Grand Master, the last of whom, Albert, converted to Protestantism and secularized the lands, which then became the Duchy of Prussia.  The Duchy was initially a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland, as a result of the terms of the Prussian Homage whereby Albert was granted the Duchy as part of the terms of peace following the Prussian War.  When the main line of Prussian Hohenzollerns died out in 1618, the Duchy passed to a different branch of the family, who also reigned as Electors of Brandenburg in the Holy Roman Empire.  While still nominally two different territories, Prussia under the suzerainty of Poland and Brandenburg under the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire, the two states are known together historiographically as Brandenburg-Prussia.  Following the Second Northern War, a series of treaties freed the Duchy of Prussia from any vassalage to any other state, making it a fully sovereign Duchy in its own right.  This complex situation (where the Hohenzollern ruler of the independent Duchy of Prussia was also a subject of the Holy Roman Emperor as Elector of Brandenburg) laid the eventual groundwork for the establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.  For diplomatic reasons, the rulers of the state were known as the King in Prussia from 1701 to 1772; largely because they still owed fealty to the Emperor as Electors of Brandenburg, the \"King in Prussia\" title (as opposed to \"King of Prussia\") avoided offending the Emperor.  As the Prussian state grew through several wars and diplomatic moves throughout the 18th century, it became apparent that Prussia had become a Great Power that did not need to submit meekly to the Holy Roman Empire.  By 1772, the pretense was dropped, and the style \"King of Prussia\" was adopted.  Thus it remained until 1871, when in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War, the King of Prussia Wilhelm I was crowned German Emperor.  From that point forward, though the Kingdom of Prussia retained its status as a constituent state of the German Empire, all remaining Kings of Prussia also served as German Emperor, and that title took precedence. Women's education in Saudi Arabia: Women's education in Saudi Arabia is, as with several other aspects of daily life, organized according to the principles of Islam, which is the official religion of the country, which is a fundamentalist religion that puts an emphasis on the importance of knowledge, study, and understanding.  The religion believes that obtaining knowledge is the only way to gain true understanding of Wahhabi Islam, and as such encourage both males and females to study.  The way of practicing Wahhabi Islam has therefore led to segregation in education in Saudi Arabia, and in turn has created segregation in political, economical, and labor force environments.  With the current struggle of social norms and laws, women have made great strides to obtain education in Saudi Arabia.  However great these strides may be, there are consequences to the economy that by not allowing women to have access to equal education, there could be economical struggle. State religion: A state religion (also called an established religion or official religion) is a religious body or creed officially endorsed by the state.  A state with an official religion, while not secular, is not necessarily a theonomy or theocracy \u2013 a country whose rulers have in their hands both secular and spiritual authority. Kotrag: Kotrag (Tatar: \"\u041a\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0433\", \"Qotra\u011f\" , Chuvash: \"\u041a\u0103\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0442\u0103\u0440\" , K\u0103tra Patt\u0103r) was a son of Kubrat of the Dulo clan of Bulgars.  Following the death of his father, he began to extend the influence of his Bulgars up the Volga river.  He is remembered as the founder of Volga Bulgaria.  His successors reached the lands of modern Tatarstan and established a state during the 7th to 9th centuries which recognised Islam as the official religion in 922 AD during the visit of Baghdad khalifat ambassador Ibn Fazlan.  This state remained independent until the 13th century, when it was conquered by the Batu-khan hordes of Mongolic and Turkic people widely known as Mongol-Tatars.  The country's capital was called Bolghar or Great \"Bulgar\"."

    "question": "Mariana Kovacevic used horse placenta treatment to heal the captian of what team? Context: Pin firing: Pin firing, also known as thermocautery, is the treatment of an injury to a horse's leg, by burning, freezing, or dousing it with acid or caustic chemicals.  This is supposed to induce a counter-irritation and speed and/or improve healing.  This treatment is used more often on racehorses than on other performance horses.  It is sometimes used in the treatment of bucked shins or splint, curb, or chronic bowed tendons.  There was also the theory that it would \"toughen\" the leg of the horse.  This treatment is prevalent in equine veterinary books published in the early 20th century; however many present-day veterinarians and horse owners consider it barbaric and a cruel form of treatment.  It is not generally taught in veterinary schools today. Slinzega: Slinzega is a type of air-dried meat produced in Valtellina, in the Italian Alps.  It is made in a similar manner to Bresaola, with smaller pieces of meat, which therefore bear a stronger taste.  According to some sources it originally used horse meat rather than beef.  Nevertheless, today virtually any type of meat is suitable to its production, the most common being beef, deer and pork. Equinalysis: Equinalysis is a computer software program designed in 2004 by consultant farrier, Haydn Price, to capture and analyse equine locomotion.  It does this by visually tracking and quantifying biomechanical data.  The system is used by veterinarians, farriers, trainers and physiotherapists to highlight subtle changes in a horse's locomotion, and provide a video record of how a horse's movements change during the course of its working life.  This then allows the user to improve the horse's performance with various techniques and treatment plans, such as appropriate shoeing regimes. Bear Lake Stake Tabernacle: The Bear Lake Stake Tabernacle, situated on main street in Paris, Idaho, is a Romanesque red sandstone meetinghouse of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints designed by Joseph Don Carlos Young.  The tabernacle was built between 1884 and 1889 by Mormon pioneers of Bear Lake Valley who used horse and ox teams to haul rock quarried from Indian Creek Canyon nearly 18 miles away.  It cost $50,000 to build and seats around 2000 people.  The tabernacle was dedicated September 15, 1889 by LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff.  In 1972 the tabernacle was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  The tabernacle was most recently refurbished in 2004-2005 and continues to operate as a meeting place for the Bear Lake Stake congregations and community.

During the duration of the 2012 African Cup of Nations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea she used the horse placenta treatment to heal Ghana's Asamoah Gyan, who had been injured and was supposed to be off football for four weeks.  She is reported to have nursed him back to health in four hours.  She was also reportedly enlisted by the Serbia during the world of 2010 in south Africa.  Other footballers who are reported to have been treated by Mariana include Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Nigel de Jong and Robin Van Persie of Manchester United.  There has been some doubt as to whether Mariana's therapies work.  But more footballers are turning to her for help. Treatment of equine lameness: The treatment of equine lameness is a complex subject.  Lameness in horses has a variety of causes, and treatment must be tailored to the type and degree of injury, as well as the financial capabilities of the owner.

The end goal is to reduce the pain and inflammation associated with injury, to encourage the injured tissue to heal with normal structure and function, and to ultimately return the horse to the highest level of performance possible following recovery. Oleai Sports Complex: Oleai Sports Complex is a multi-use stadium in Saipan on the western Pacific Ocean Northern Mariana Islands.

She was a researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Washington for nearly forty years.  While performing an autopsy in 1934, she discovered a 14-day old human embryo, the earliest yet studied at the time.  Later in her career, Dr. Ramsey worked on a team that used cineradiology to reveal the workings of the placental circulatory system in primates. Asipu: In ancient Mesopotamia, asipu (also \u0101\u0161ipu or ma\u0161ma\u0161u)\", \"were scholars and practitioners of diagnosis and treatment in Tigris-Euphrates valley of Mesopotamia (a modern-day Iraq) around 3200 BC.  Some have described asipu as experts in \"white magic\".  At the time, ideas of science, religion and witchcraft were closely intertwined and formed a basis of asiputu, the practice used by asipu to combat sorcery and to heal disease.  The asipu studied omens and symptoms to formulate a prediction of the future for a subject and then performed apotropaic rituals in an attempt to change the unfavorable fate."

Missouri Photo Workshop: The Missouri Photo Workshop is an annual week-long photojournalism school based in Lee Hills Hall at the Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia, Missouri.  Founded in 1949 by the \"Father of Photojournalism\" Cliff Edom along with American economist, federal government official, and photographer Roy Stryker and photographer Russell Lee, the workshop originally sought to instruct others in photojournalism based on the \"gritty, content-rich photographs\" produced by the pre-World War II (pre-1939) Farm Security Administration, a United States government effort during the Great Depression to combat American rural poverty.  Following Edom's credo - \"Show truth with a camera.  Ideally truth is a matter of personal integrity.  In no circumstances will a posed or faked photograph be tolerated.\"  - each workshop originates in a different small town in Missouri, which is used as a backdrop for attendees from the United States and other countries to work on photograph storytelling methods such as research, observation, and timing.  Missouri Photo Workshop faculty members have included the White House's first photo editor and NPPA Picture Editor of the Year Sandra Eisert and other prominent photojournalists.

    "question": "What does the unique calendar system in Japan, who the first Emperor of Japan created, emphasize? Context: Borana calendar: The Borana calendar is a calendrical system once thought to have been used by the Borana Oromo based upon an earlier Cushitic calendar developed around 300 BC found at Namoratunga.  Reconsideration of the Namoratunga site led astronomer and archaeologist Clive Ruggles to conclude that there is no relationship.  The Borana calendar consist of 29.5 days and 12 months for a total 354 days in a year.The calendar has no weeks but name for each day of the month.  It is a lunar-stellar calendar system. Calendar date: A calendar date is a reference to a particular day represented within a calendar system.  The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified.  The number of days between two dates may be calculated.  For example, \"24 2017\" is ten days after \"14 2017\" in the Gregorian calendar.  The date of a particular event depends on the observed time zone.  For example, the air attack on Pearl Harbor that began at 7:48\u00a0a.m. Hawaiian time on December 7, 1941, took place at 3:18\u00a0a.m. December 8 in Japan (Japan Standard Time). Qin Shi Huang: Qin Shi Huang ( ; 18 February 25910 September 210) was the founder of the Qin dynasty (\u79e6\u671d ) and was the first emperor of a unified China.  He was born Ying Zheng (\u5b34\u653f ) or Zhao Zheng (\u8d99\u653f ), a prince of the state of Qin.  He became the King Zheng of Qin (\u79e6\u738b\u653f ) when he was thirteen, then China's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had conquered all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC.  Rather than maintain the title of \"king\" borne by the previous Shang and Zhou rulers, he ruled as the First Emperor (\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d ) of the Qin dynasty from 220 to 210 BC.  His self-invented title \"emperor\" (\u7687\u5e1d , \"\u00a0 \"), as indicated by his use of the word \"First\", would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia. Common Era: Common Era or Current Era (CE) is a year-numbering system (calendar era) for the Julian and Gregorian calendars that refers to the years since the start of this era, that is, the years beginning with AD 1.  The preceding era is referred to as before the Common or Current Era (BCE).  The Current Era notation system can be used as an alternative to the Dionysian era system, which distinguishes eras as AD (\"anno Domini \", \"[the] year of [the] Lord\") and BC (\"before Christ\").  The two notation systems are numerically equivalent; thus \"2017 CE\" corresponds to \"AD 2017 \" and \"400 BCE\" corresponds to \"400 BC\".  The year-numbering system for the Gregorian calendar is the most widespread civil calendar system used in the world today.  For decades, it has been the global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations and the Universal Postal Union. Luoxia Hong: Luoxia Hong (ca. 130-70 BCE) was a Chinese astronomer during the Han Dynasty.  A folk astronomer from southwest China, Hong was one of over twenty astronomers who traveled to Chang'an (now Xi'an) to propose a new calendar system for Emperor Wu.  It was not uncommon for emperors to introduce new calendars in order to place greater emphasis on heavenly bodies that were seen as particularly astrologically relevant to the particular ruler, but this reform was of such a scale that it was called the \"Grand Inception\" (\u592a\u521d) in contemporary documents.  The calendar made by Hong and his associate Deng Ping was accepted over that of other contestants, including several imperial astronomers.  It included 12 months of 29 or 30 days, with an additional month in seven out of 19 years.  It also included precise calculations for the movement of the sun, moon, planets, and the time of eclipses, which Hong was able to predict using an equatorial armillary sphere which he significantly improved, or possibly even invented.  The \"Tai Chu\" lunisolar calendar went into effect in 104 BCE, and remained substantially unchanged for nearly 2,000 years.  Emperor Wu offered Hong an official position at court, but Hong declined and returned to solitary life. Leap week calendar: A leap week calendar is a calendar system with a whole number of weeks every year, and with every year starting on the same weekday.  Most leap week calendars are proposed reforms to the civil calendar, in order to achieve a perennial calendar.  Some, however, such as the ISO week date calendar, are simply conveniences for specific purposes. Emperor Jimmu: Emperor Jimmu (\u795e\u6b66\u5929\u7687 , Jinmu-tenn\u014d ) was the first Emperor of Japan, according to legend.  His accession is traditionally dated as 660 BC.  According to Japanese mythology, he is a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, through her grandson Ninigi, as well as a descendant of the storm god Susanoo.  He launched a military expedition from Hyuga near the Inland Sea, captured Yamato, and established this as his center of power.  In modern Japan, Jimmu's accession is marked as National Foundation Day on February 11. Lunar calendar: A lunar calendar is a calendar based upon cycles of the Moon's phases (synodic months), in contrast to solar calendars whose annual cycles are based only directly upon the solar year.  The most commonly used calendar, the Gregorian calendar, is a solar calendar system which originally evolved out of a lunar calendar system.  A purely lunar calendar is also distinguished from lunisolar calendars whose lunar months are brought into alignment with the solar year through some process of intercalation.  The details of when months begin varies from calendar to calendar, with some using new, full, or crescent moons and others employing detailed calculations. Calendar year: Generally speaking, a calendar year begins on the New Year's Day of the given calendar system and ends on the day before the following New Year's Day, and thus consists of a whole number of days.  A year can be measured by also starting on any other named day of the calendar, and end on the day before this named day in the following year.  This may be termed as a \"years time\" but not in practice or an accepted means to term a Calendar year.  To reconcile the calendar year with the astronomical cycle (which has a fractional number of days) certain years contain extra days. Japanese imperial year: The Japanese imperial year (\u7687\u7d00 , k\u014dki ) or \"national calendar year\" is a unique calendar system in Japan.  It is based on the legendary foundation of Japan by Emperor Jimmu in 660 BC.  \"K\u014dki\" emphasizes the long history of Japan and the Imperial dynasty."

He played an early role in helping bring to light malpractices carried out under the system of Indian indentured labour.  In 1909, George Fitzpatrick provided testimony before a British parliamentary investigation, led by Lord Sanderson, regarding alleged mistreatment of East Indian labourers living in Trinidad.  The Sanderson Committee, however, failed to bring about the immediate abolition of the indentured system, only its postponement, which was further deferred by the onset of the First World War.  It was not until January 2, 1920, that the system of indentured labour would come to an end.  George F. Fitzpatrick's son, Hon. George Fitzpatrick, trained as a solicitor and served a three-year term as member of parliament, representing the district of San Fernando.

    "question": "John ruskin named his album due to a removal of what? Context: I Gotta Rash/We Are Thee Goblins from Canada: I Gotta Rash/We Are Thee Goblins From Canada is a split album between Nardwuar the Human Serviette's two bands, The Evaporators, and Thee Goblins.  It was released in 1998 as an LP with a free CD.  The name I Gotta Rash comes from the time Jello Biafra drew on Nardwuar's face with a marker pen, the subsequent removal of which resulted in a rash. The Seven Lamps of Architecture: The Seven Lamps of Architecture is an extended essay, first published in May 1849 and written by the English art critic and theorist John Ruskin.  The 'lamps' of the title are Ruskin's principles of architecture, which he later enlarged upon in the three-volume \"The Stones of Venice\".  To an extent, they codified some of the contemporary thinking behind the Gothic Revival.  At the time of its publication A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Revival and it was well under way in practice.  Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement.  \"The Seven Lamps\" also proved a great popular success, and received the approval of the ecclesiologists typified by the Cambridge Camden Society, who criticised in their publication \"The Ecclesiologist\" lapses committed by modern architects in ecclesiastical commissions. Ruskin Pottery: The Ruskin Pottery was an English pottery studio founded in 1898 by Edward R. Taylor, the first Principal of both the Lincoln School of Art and the Birmingham School of Art, to be run by his son, William Howson Taylor, formerly a student there.  It was named after the artist, writer and social thinker John Ruskin, as the Taylors agreed with, and followed the tenets of Ruskin.  The pottery was situated at 173-174 Oldbury Road, Smethwick, then in Staffordshire (now part of Sandwell, in the West Midlands county). Modern Painters: Modern Painters (1843\u201360) is a five-volume work by the eminent Victorian art critic, John Ruskin, begun when he was 24 years old.  Ruskin argues that recent painters emerging from the tradition of the picturesque are superior in the art of landscape to the old masters.  The book was primarily written as a defence of the later work of J.M.W. Turner.  Ruskin used the book to argue that art should devote itself to the accurate documentation of nature.  In Ruskin's view, Turner had developed from early detailed documentation of nature to a later more profound insight into natural forces and atmospheric effects.  It was in his 1842 visit to Switzerland that Ruskin collected material used to form the basis of Vol One. The Passion of John Ruskin: The Passion of John Ruskin is a Canadian short film released in 1994 based on the love life of writer and critic John Ruskin.

John Ruskin was an early advocate of the Pre-Raphaelite group of artists and part of their success was due to his efforts. Ruskin College: Ruskin College, originally known as Ruskin Hall, Oxford, is an independent educational institution in Oxford, England.

Ruskin Colony: The Ruskin Colony (or Ruskin Commonwealth Association) was a utopian socialist colony which existed near Tennessee City in Dickson County, Tennessee from 1894 to 1896.  The colony moved to a slightly more permanent second settlement on an old farm five miles north from 1896 to 1899, and saw another brief incarnation near Waycross, in southern Georgia, from 1899 until it finally dissolved in 1901.  Its regional location within the Southern United States set it apart from many other similar utopian projects of the era.  At its high point, the population was around 250.  The colony was named after John Ruskin, the English socialist writer.  A cave on the colony's second property in Dickson County still carries his name.  The site of the colony's second settlement in Dickson County is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nardwuar the Human Serviette: John Ruskin (born July 5, 1968), better known as Nardwuar the Human Serviette, is a Canadian interviewer and musician from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  He is the lead singer and keyboardist for The Evaporators and plays in Thee Goblins.

Concealed shoes: Concealed shoes hidden in the fabric of a building have been discovered in many European countries, as well as in other parts of the world, since at least the early modern period.  Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found\u00a0\u2013 in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof\u00a0\u2013 suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches.  Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.

The Powerhouse (San Luis Obispo, California): The Powerhouse is a historic building located on the campus of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California.  Built from 1908 to 1910, the building was designed by William H. Weeks in the Mission Revival style.  The Powerhouse was the last of the original buildings at Cal Poly to be constructed; however, it is now the only remaining original building on its campus.  The building originally served as a power plant run by students and two full-time supervisors; it also held Mechanics and Electrical Engineering classes.  The Powerhouse stopped generating power in the 1940s and was replaced entirely and abandoned in 1955.  In 1967, the building found a new use when the school's College of Architecture and Environmental Design decided to hold classes there.

Sanheyuan have structures on three sides of a courtyard, forming an inverted U-shape, resembling the Chinese character \u51f9 (pinyin: \"\u0101o\").  There is normally a wall linking the two forward-thrusting side wings, called \u5ec2\u623f (pinyin: \"xi\u0101ngf\u00e1ng\"), similar to the wings of a siheyuan.  Sanheyuan may be square or rectangular shaped and can be single or multiple-story structures.  Typically there are three structural divisions within the horizontal building in the U, which is called a \"three-jian\" building (Chinese: \u4e09\u9593\u5c4b; pinyin: \"s\u0101nji\u0101nw\u016b\").  The purpose of this main building varies by region, but typically consists of a central room serving ceremonial needs flanked on either side by a bedroom.  The two wings making up the arms of the U may be long or short, according to need, and provide room for kitchens, toilets, storage, and additional bedrooms.  In Taiwan, the wings of the sanheyuan are called \"protecting dragons\" (Chinese: \u8b77\u9f8d; pinyin: \"h\u00f9l\u00f3ng\").  Additional \"hulong\" would typically be added in pairs, placed parallel to the first set and then duplicated as the household grew.  The inner pair of \"hulong\" were traditionally called \"inner protectors\" (Chinese: \u5167\u8b77; pinyin: \"n\u00e8ih\u00f9\"), the second pair \"outer protectors\" (Chinese: \u5916\u8b77; pinyin: \"w\u00e0ih\u00f9\"), and so on.

Context: Mickey Mouse cup: \"Mickey Mouse Cup\" is a subjective term used in football, particularly in English football, to negatively describe a cup, league, or other competition as being of a lower standard, importance or significance to a football club or manager relative to other competitions.  The term was first coined by fans of Manchester United as a way of disparaging their rivals Liverpool's achievements and success in the League Cup.  The term has been applied to lesser Confederation competitions such as the UEFA Super Cup.  \"Mickey Mouser\" itself originated as rhyming slang for Scouser, a person from Liverpool.

It is also commonly known by the collective term \"G\u00f6teborgsderby\" (English: Gothenburg derby ) which is also used for other fixtures between Gothenburg clubs.  GAIS started playing football in 1897 and IFK G\u00f6teborg was founded in 1904, meeting each other for the very first time in 1905.  GAIS had its glory period from the late 1910s to the early 1930s, while IFK have been the dominant team for the rest of the derby's existence, winning 18 Swedish championships as well as two UEFA Cup titles.  The record attendance for second tier football in Sweden, and all club football outside Allsvenskan, was set at a derby in 1976.

Another name is often used in the press is \"South Derby\", which comes from the location of Basra province in southern Iraq.  The animosity intensified since the first match, as Naft Al-Janoob was not expected to win Al-Minaa 1\u20130, and the exaggerated protest by Al-Minaa supporters to referee of match Khalil Yousuf prompted him to retire arbitration forever.  and this animosity reached a peak during the 2010\u201311 season, when both teams played at the end of the season in the Premier League in a match, that if it end at a draw, Naft Al-Janoob will relegate to the Iraq Division One.

The clubs, which were both founded during the 1880s, met competitively for the first time in the 1898\u201399 FA Cup.  Following this they played each other regularly in the Southern League and The Football League until 1936\u201337, when Luton's promotion separated them in league competition until 1963\u201364.  The animosity intensified during the late 1960s and the 1970s, and reached a peak during the 1980s, when both teams played in the top-flight First Division.  Watford were relegated at the end of the 1987\u201388 season, while Luton followed four years later."

He has recorded over a hundred complete operas and is well known for his versatility, regularly performing in Italian, French, German, Spanish, English and Russian in the most prestigious opera houses in the world.  Although primarily a \"lirico-spinto\" tenor for most of his career, especially popular for his Cavaradossi, Hoffmann, Don Jos\u00e9, and Canio, he quickly moved into more dramatic roles, becoming the most acclaimed Otello of his generation.  In the early 2010s, he transitioned from the tenor repertory into almost exclusively baritone parts, most notably Simon Boccanegra.  He has performed 147 different roles. Pepita Embil: Josefa \"Pepita\" Embil Ech\u00e1niz (Basque: \"Josefa Enbil Etxaniz\"; February 28, 1918\u2014August 28, 1994) was a Spanish Basque soprano who starred in zarzuela and operetta productions throughout Spain and Latin America.

Embil began her professional career singing as a soloist in choirs, including the Basque national choir, Eresoinka, which based itself in France during the Spanish Civil War.  While still in her twenties, she appeared in the world premieres of several new zarzuelas.  She collaborated with some of the most prominent Spanish composers of the 1940s, including Federico Moreno Torroba, Jacinto Guerrero, and Pablo Soroz\u00e1bal.  In late 1948, she moved to Mexico with her baritone husband, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Ferrer.  In Mexico they ran a successful zarzuela company of their own, which toured throughout the Americas.

The book received high-level publicity during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, as journalists compared Lewis' \"hints\" of an affair with popular opera singer, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, to Lewinsky\u2019s then-unproven allegations against U.S. President Bill Clinton.  Domingo insisted that he only knew Lewis socially. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Ferrer: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Ferrer (8 March 1907 \u2013 22 November 1987) was a Spanish zarzuela baritone and father of popular operatic tenor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo.

Context: String Quartet No. 6 (Bart\u00f3k): The String Quartet No. 6, Sz.  114, BB 119, was the final string quartet that B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k wrote before his death.  It was begun in August 1939 in Saanen, Switzerland, where Bart\u00f3k was a guest of his patron, the conductor Paul Sacher.  Shortly after he completed the Divertimento for String Orchestra on the 17th, he started on a commission for his friend, the violinist Zolt\u00e1n Sz\u00e9kely.  Sz\u00e9kely was acting as intermediary for the \"New Hungarian Quartet\", who had given the Budapest premiere of the String Quartet No. 5.  With the outbreak of World War II and his mother's illness, Bart\u00f3k returned to Budapest, where the quartet was finished in November.  After his mother's death, Bart\u00f3k decided to leave with his family for the United States.  Due to the difficulties of the war, communication between Bart\u00f3k and Sz\u00e9kely was difficult, and the quartet was not premiered until 20 January 1941, when the Kolisch Quartet, to whom the work is dedicated, gave its premiere at the Town Hall in New York City. B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k: B\u00e9la Viktor J\u00e1nos Bart\u00f3k ( ; ] ; 25 March 1881 \u2013 26 September 1945) was a Hungarian composer, pianist and an ethnomusicologist.

List of string quartets by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k: The Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k wrote six string quartets, each for the usual forces of two violins, viola and cello.  Notable composers who have been influenced by them include Benjamin Britten, particularly in the Sonata in C for Cello and Piano (; ), Elliott Carter, who refers in the opening of his own First String Quartet to Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Sixth Quartet , Chen Yi , Edison Denisov, whose Second Quartet is closely related to Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Fifth Quartet , Franco Donatoni, who was deeply impressed when he heard a broadcast of Bart\u00f3k's Fourth Quartet , Robert Fripp, who mentions them as an influence upon King Crimson , Miloslav I\u0161tvan , Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g, whose Opp.  1 and 28 both owe a great deal to Bart\u00f3k's quartets (; ), Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, whose two string quartets both owe a great deal to Bart\u00f3k\u2019s quartets (; ), Bruno Maderna , George Perle, who credits the Bart\u00f3k Fourth and Fifth Quartets as precedents for his use of arrays of chords related to one another by different types of symmetry , Walter Piston (; ), Kim Dzmitr\u00efyevich Tsesakow , Wilfried Westerlinck , Stefan Wolpe, who explained in a public lecture how he had derived ideas from Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Fourth Quartet , and Xu Yongsan .

Note that Bart\u00f3k started three times anew with opus numbers, here indicated with \"(list 1)\", \"(list 2)\" and \"(list 3)\" respectively.  The pieces from the third listing are by far best known; opus lists 1 and 2 are early works.  The year of composition and instrumentation (including voice) are included.  See the main article on B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k for more details. Palace of Music (Miskolc): The Palace of Music (\"Zenepalota\") is a building in Bart\u00f3k square, Miskolc, Hungary.  It is the building of the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Secondary School and the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Music Institute (a faculty of the University of Miskolc.)  The Palace was designed by Gyula Waelder in Neo-baroque style and was built between 1926 and 1927.  The construction was financed from USA loans, just like that of the Hotel Palace in Lillaf\u00fcred and the Market Hall on B\u00faza t\u00e9r. Suite, Op. 14 (Bart\u00f3k): The Suite, Op. 14, Sz.  62, BB 70 is a piece for solo piano written by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.  It was written in February 1916, published in 1918, and debuted by the composer on April 21, 1919, in Budapest.  The Suite is one of Bart\u00f3k's most significant works for piano, only comparable with his 1926 Piano Sonata.  Though much of Bart\u00f3k's work makes frequent use of Eastern European folk music, this suite is one of the few pieces without melodies of folk origin.  However, Romanian, Arabic, and North African rhythmic influences can still be found in some movements.  Originally intending the suite to be a five-movement work, Bart\u00f3k later decided against the idea and discarded the second movement, the \"Andante\", which was published only posthumously in the October 1955 issue of \"\u00daj Zenei Szemle\" (New Musical Review). Paul Hindemith: Paul Hindemith ( ) (16 November 1895 \u2013 28 December 1963) was a prolific German composer, violist, violinist, teacher and conductor.  Notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), and opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938).  Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is likely the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\", written in 1943."

    "question": "The movie that was the directorial debut of Jonathan Glazer included the musical piece Lujon. Which other movie that has the letter \"B\" in it also includes this piece? Context: Sheet music: Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece.  Like its analogs \u2013 printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages \u2013 the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \"play back\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. Sexy Beast: Sexy Beast is a 2000 British crime film and the directorial debut of Jonathan Glazer.  Glazer had previously directed music videos and commercials for companies such as Guinness and Levi's.  The film stars Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley and Ian McShane. Metamorphosis of Vivaldi's Four Seasons: Metamorphosis of Vivaldi's Four Seasons is a musical piece featuring guitarist Uli Jon Roth's interpretation of Antonio Vivaldi's work \"The Four Seasons\", in a rock-classical fusion.  The album also includes a new concerto, \"Metamorphosis\".  \"Metamorphosis\" is separated into 24 tracks bridged by soundscapes and narration.  It was released in Europe and Japan in 2003, and in North America in 2004. Lujon: \"Lujon\" (also known as \"Slow Hot Wind\") is a musical piece by Henry Mancini.  It appeared on his 1961 album \"Mr. Lucky Goes Latin\", but was an original piece of music that had nothing to do with the \"Mr. Lucky\" television program.  It was included in the soundtracks for the films \"The Big Lebowski\", \"Sexy Beast\", \"W.E.\", and \"Two Lovers\".  Its name comes from the lujon percussion instrument heard on the recording. Under the Skin (novel): Under the Skin is a 2000 novel by Michel Faber.  Set in northern Scotland, it traces an extraterrestrial who, manifesting in human form, drives around the Scottish countryside picking up male hitchhikers whom she drugs and delivers to her home planet.  The novel, which was Faber's debut, was shortlisted for the 2000 Whitbread Award.  It was later adapted into a feature film by Jonathan Glazer. Musical composition: Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. Reassuringly Expensive: Reassuringly Expensive was the Stella Artois' advertising slogan in the United Kingdom from 1982 until 2007.  The 1990s UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotif taken from the score of \"Jean de Florette\", inspired, in turn, by Giuseppe Verdi's \"La forza del destino\".  The TV campaigns began in 1991 with a series of adverts based on \"Jean de Florette\", directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres including war movies, silent comedy and even surrealism (for which the slogan was changed to \"Reassuringly Elephants\").  They have used notable movie directors such as Jonathan Glazer, and their aim was to portray the drink in a context of sophisticated European culture. Surfer (advertisement): Surfer is a critically acclaimed integrated advertising campaign launched in 1999 by Diageo to promote Guinness-brand draught stout in the United Kingdom.  The cornerstone of the campaign is a television commercial, originally 60\u00a0seconds long, which centred on a Polynesian surfer successfully taking on a gigantic wave.  Shot in Hawaii over a nine-day period and directed by Jonathan Glazer, the piece went on to win more awards than any other commercial in 1999 (Clio Awards, D&AD Awards, Cannes Lions), and in 2002 was voted the \"Best ad of all time\" in a poll conducted by Channel 4 and \"The Sunday Times\". Dreamer (advertisement): Dreamer (also known as Dream Club) is an integrated advertising campaign launched by Diageo in 2001 to promote Guinness-brand draught stout in the United Kingdom.  It is the fourth piece of the Good things come to those who wait campaign, following on from \"Swimblack\", \"Surfer\", and \"Bet on Black\".  As with the previous pieces of the campaign, \"Dreamer\" was handled by advertising agency Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO and comprised appearances in print, posters, and television and cinema spots.  The centrepiece of the campaign was the sixty-second television and cinema commercial directed by Jonathan Glazer, who had also directed two of the three previous ads.  Post production work was completed by The Computer Film Company which animated the squirrel sequence.  The piece was premiered on SKY television on 6 April 2001, appearing on terrestrial television channels the following day. Jonathan Glazer: Jonathan Glazer (born 26 March 1965) is an English filmmaker, whose directing work includes feature films, music videos and advertisements."

    "question": "Pak Sao is a technique in the martial art specializing in what type of fighting? Context: Soo Bahk Do: Soo Bahk Do is a martial art founded and taught by Kwan Jang Nim Hwang Kee, his successor Hwang Hyun Chul, known as H.C. Hwang, and instructors who are certified by member organizations of the World Moo Duk Kwan, Inc.  This martial art was originally the ancient martial art of Korea.  Hwang Kee created Moo Duk Kwan with influence from \"Soo Bahk Do\" Hwa Rang Do: Hwa Rang Do, also known as \"The Way of the Flowering Knights\" (Hangul:\u00a0\ud654\ub791\ub3c4 ; Hanja:\u00a0\u82b1\u90de\u9053 ) is a comprehensive Korean martial art that was developed in the 1960s by Joo Bang Lee and his brother Joo Sang Lee.  Hwa Rang Do as a martial art has multiple areas of focus including stand up fighting with open-hand striking, weapons, throws and takedowns, ground fighting, various types of meditative practices, intellectual and character development, and artistic and cultural pursuits. Angampora: Angampora (Sinhalese: \u0d85\u0d82\u0d9c\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0ddc\u0dbb , is a form of martial art from Sri Lanka that combines combat techniques, self-defense, sport, exercise, and meditation.  A key component of angampora is the namesake \"angam\", which incorporates hand-to-hand fighting, and \"illangam\", involving the use of indigenous weapons such as the ethunu kaduwa, staves, knives and swords.  Another component known as \"maya angam\", which uses spells and incantations for combat, is also said to have existed.  Angampora's distinct feature lies in the use of pressure point attacks to inflict pain or permanently paralyze the opponent.  Fighters usually make use of both striking and grappling techniques, and fight until the opponent is caught in a submission lock that they cannot escape.  Usage of weapons is discretionary.  Perimeters of fighting are defined in advance, and in some of the cases is a pit.  With the advent of colonialism over the entirety of the island in 1815, Angampora fell into disuse and was very nearly lost as a part of the country's heritage.  The British administration prohibited its practice due to the dangers posed by a civilian populace versed in a martial art, burning down any \"angan madu\" (practice huts devoted to the martial art) found: flouting of the law was punished by a gunshot to the knee, effectively crippling practitioners; Angampora nevertheless survived within a few families, allowing it to emerge into mainstream Sri Lankan culture post-independence. Hee Il Cho: Cho Hee Il (born October 13, 1940) is a prominent Korean-American master of taekwondo, holding the rank of 9th \"dan\" in the martial art.  He has written 11 martial art books, produced 70 martial art training videos, and has appeared on more than 70 martial arts magazine covers.  Cho won several national and international competitions as a taekwondo competitor, and has appeared in several films, including \"Fight to Win\", \"Best of the Best\", \"Bloodsport II\", and \"Bloodsport III\".  He founded the Action International Martial Arts Association (AIMAA) in 1980, and is its President.  Cho is a member of both \"Black Belt\" magazine's Hall of Fame and \"Tae Kwon Do Times\" magazine's Hall of Fame. Lerdrit: Lerdrit (Thai: \u0e40\u0e25\u0e34\u0e28\u0e24\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c, rtgs: loetrit, IPA: [l\u0264\u0302\u02d0t.r\u00edt]) is a Thai martial art taught and used by the Royal Thai Army.  Muay Lert Rit (or Lerdrit) is a style of fighting derived from Thai Martial Arts (Muay Boran).  A selection was made among the very large portfolio of techniques already available in the different styles and adapted to close combat.  Many of the technique can be used very close or taken directly from the Mae Mai (Standard techniques for bare hand fighting) or the Look Mai (Advanced fighting techniques).  As with all military techniques, the goal is radical. Taijutsu: Taijutsu (\u4f53\u8853 , literally \"body technique\" or \"body skill\") is a Japanese blanket term for any combat skill, technique or system of martial art using body movements that are described as an empty-hand combat skill or system.  The term is commonly used when referring to a traditional Japanese martial art but has also been used in the naming of modern martial arts such as Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu.  Taijutsu is similar to Karate but is more focused on the body techniques.  More specific names than taijutsu are typically used when describing a martial art, such as jujutsu (focusing on throwing, grappling, and submission), judo (focusing on throwing and grappling), aikido (focusing on throwing and joint locks) as well as karate and kenp\u014d (focusing on striking). Pak Sao: In Wing Chun martial arts, Pak Sao is a blocking technique similar to a parry used in boxing.  With \"Pak Sao\", the hand comes directly out of the center of the body to slap away an attacker's strike to one's head.  Effective application of \"Pak Sao\" involves creating an angle of deflection through which the opponent's blow can be slapped away with minimal effort. List of Sword Art Online episodes: \"Sword Art Online\" is a science fantasy anime series adapted from the light novel series of the same title written by Reki Kawahara and illustrated by Abec.

New York Society of Model Engineers: The New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City.  There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.

    "question": "Johnny Edwards and Ian Anderson are singers, who had joined the greater number of bands? Context: Belize National Youth Chess Foundation: The Belize National Youth Chess Foundation (B.N.Y.C.F.) was co-founded by Ian & Ella Anderson in the summer of 2007 as a not-for-profit organization and with a small army of volunteers it spread throughout the country.  The game of Chess has been around for a very long time but in Belize there were no formal organizations and no figures to indicate how many people were playing the game.  Building on the founding by Mr. Robert Landolfi and Mr. Glen Reneau of the first school chess club at Hummingird Elementary and the Belize Association of Chess Players in Belize City, due to the efforts of the B.N.Y.C.F. there are now teams ranging from the most southern villages in Toledo District to the most northern villages along the Belize-Mexico border in the Corozal District.  Since 2007, the organization has more than 50 active chess clubs and over 1400 players around the country and it functions all year round.  An interview with Ian Anderson, Co-Chair, reveals that chess is not only a pastime or hobby in Belize; it can and should be used \u201cas an educational tool to help develop the minds of primary school students.\u201d  The B.N.Y.C.F. has worked with primary schools to successfully integrate chess as a part of the curriculum of the primary schools in Belize.  Within one year the game of Chess became the fastest growing sport in the country.  As part of its efforts to promote this sport, the B.N.Y.C.F. assisted the Belize Chess Federation to become active again in 2008 by updating fees due to FIDE, the World Chess affiliate. Dead to Me: Dead to Me is a punk rock band from San Francisco, founded by vocalist/guitarist Jack Dalrymple, drummer Brandon Pollack (both from the band One Man Army) and bassist/vocalist Chicken of Western Addiction.

He was born in Southampton, Hampshire, England.  He originally played flute and saxophone but with the increasing popularity of guitars in bands it was decided that Manfred Mann should have a guitarist in its line-up.  Vickers volunteered for this role but he was always happiest playing woodwind.  His tough flute soloing on hard blues tracks such as \"Without You\" prefigured the work of Ian Anderson with Jethro Tull five years later.  As the group were all multi-instrumentalists who delighted in instrumental solos, multi-tracking was used to allow Vickers to perform on guitar and woodwind on the same recordings, while drummer Mike Hugg similarly doubled on vibraphone. King Kobra III: King Kobra III, released in 1988 on New Renaissance Records, was the first and last album by the Edwards, Michael-Phillips, Northrup, Hart and Appice line-up of King Kobra.

Gerald Bostock: Gerald Bostock is a fictional character originally created by Ian Anderson for his band Jethro Tull's 1972 concept album, \"Thick as a Brick\"; Bostock is credited with writing the lyrics to the album (though Anderson in fact authored them himself).  Bostock is also the focus of Anderson's 2012 solo album, \"Thick as a Brick 2: Whatever Happened to Gerald Bostock? \", as well as the purported lyricist for Anderson's 2014 solo album \"Homo Erraticus\". Wild Horses (US rock band): Wild Horses was a band that originally featured former Buster Brown and Montrose members Johnny Edwards and James Kottak.  The band also featured James Kottak's former Kingdom Come bandmate Rick Steier.  The band went through at least two bassists: Chris Lester and Jeff Pilson.

Ian Anderson: Ian Scott Anderson, MBE (born 10 August 1947) is a Scottish-born musician, singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist best known for his work as the lead vocalist, flautist and acoustic guitarist of British rock band Jethro Tull.

    "question": "The song \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" can be heard  in the \"Mary Poppins\" scene of a Disney ride that debuted in what year? Context: I Love to Laugh: \"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\".  It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself.  The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood.  (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.)  Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again.  The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well. Step in Time: \"Step In Time\" is a song and dance number from Walt Disney's 1964 film \"Mary Poppins\", and it is composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The choreography for this song was provided by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.  It is sung by Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and the other chimney sweeps on the rooftops of London.  In the first part of the song, the lines he says in the verses are \"Kick your knees up\", \"'Round the chimney\", \"Flap like a birdie\", \"Up on the railing\", \"Over the rooftops\" and \"Link your elbows\" followed by an interlude.  The interlude continues with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops and as Admiral Boom looks at them with the telescope, he thinks that they're Hottentots, so he orders Mr. Binnacle to make them scram with colorful fireworks.  In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, \"They're at it again!\"  and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan.  As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an \"OW!\"  and the chimney sweepers flip her.  The other phrases in the rest of the musical number are \"Votes for women,\" \"It's the master,\" and \"What's all this?\" My Kind of Town: \"My Kind of Town\" or \"My Kind of Town (Chicago Is)\" is a popular song composed by Jimmy Van Heusen, with lyrics by Sammy Cahn.  It was originally part of the musical score for \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\", a 1964 musical film starring several members of the Rat Pack.  It was nominated for the 1964 Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" from \"Mary Poppins\".  Although the song predated the Grammy Award Best Original Song for a Motion Picture category, the entire score was nominated for the 1964 Grammy Award in the category Best Original Score Written for A Motion Picture, but it lost to the eponymously titled \"Mary Poppins\" score. A Man Has Dreams: \"A Man Has Dreams\" is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\", written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song melody is a slowed down version of \"The Life I Lead\" which serves as Banks's leitmotif as he was fired.  In both the motion picture and the stage musical, the song is performed as a conversational duet between Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and George Banks (David Tomlinson).  It is operatic in nature, sung dialogue, and was highly unusual for a musical film of that era.  The song incorporates a reprise of \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" which is Mary Poppins's leitmotif. Mary Poppins Opens the Door: Mary Poppins Opens the Door is a British children's fantasy novel by the Australian-British writer P.L. Travers, the third book and last novel in the \"Mary Poppins\" series that features the magical English nanny Mary Poppins.  It was published in 1943 by Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc and illustrated by Mary Shepard and Agnes Sims. Mary Poppins Returns: Mary Poppins Returns (also known as Mary Poppins 2) is an upcoming American musical fantasy film directed by Rob Marshall and written by David Magee.  It is the sequel to the 1964 film \"Mary Poppins\".  The film stars Emily Blunt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer, Pixie Davies, Joel Dawson, Nathanael Saleh, Julie Walters, Colin Firth, Dick Van Dyke and Meryl Streep.  Set 25 years after the 1964 film, it will feature Mary Poppins, the former nanny of Jane and Michael Banks, re-visiting them after a family tragedy.  The film is scheduled for release on December 25, 2018, giving it one of the longest gaps between film sequels in history. Chim Chim Cher-ee: \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" is a song from \"Mary Poppins\", the 1964 musical motion picture.  It was originally sung by Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, and also is featured in the Cameron Mackintosh/Disney \"Mary Poppins\" musical.  The song can be heard in the \"Mary Poppins\" scene of The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios and during the \"Mary Poppins\" segment of \"\" at Disneyland. Mary Poppins (film): Mary Poppins is a 1964 American musical-fantasy film directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Walt Disney, with songs written and composed by the Sherman Brothers.  The screenplay is by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, loosely based on P. L. Travers' book series \"Mary Poppins\".  The film, which combines live-action and animation, stars Julie Andrews in the role of Mary Poppins who visits a dysfunctional family in London and employs her unique brand of lifestyle to improve the family's dynamic.  Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Johns are featured in supporting roles.  The film was shot entirely at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California using painted London background scenes. Mary Poppins (song): \"Mary Poppins\" is a song from the 2015 stage musical \"Love Birds\" with music and lyrics by Robert J. Sherman.  It is sung by \"The Original Quack Pack\", a penguin barbershop quartet who resemble the penguins from the 1964 Walt Disney motion picture, \"Mary Poppins\".  In dialogue leading up to the song, the penguins explain that while they did know the same nanny, (Mary Poppins) they are not the same penguins as in the movie.  The song expresses their longing for the magical nanny of literary fame. The Great Movie Ride: The Great Movie Ride was a dark ride attraction located at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Walt Disney World Resort.  The attraction employed the use of Audio-Animatronic figures, practical sets, live actors, special effects, and projections to recreate iconic scenes from twelve classic films throughout motion picture history.  The attraction\u2014which debuted with the park on May 1, 1989\u2014was located inside a replica of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, one of Hollywood's most famous movie palaces."

River Song was introduced to the series as an experienced future companion of series protagonist the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time in his TARDIS.  Because River Song is a time traveller herself, her adventures with the Doctor occur out of synchronisation; their first meeting (from the audience's perspective) is his first and apparently her last.  In later appearances, River is a companion, romantic interest and eventual wife of the Doctor in his eleventh incarnation portrayed by Matt Smith.  River Song was created by \"Doctor Who\" writer Steven Moffat for the show's fourth series in 2008, under the tenure of executive producer Russell T Davies.  When Moffat took over Davies' duties as executive producer, he began expanding on the character's background, depicting adventures earlier in River's timeline, upgrading Alex Kingston from a guest star to a recurring actor in the series.

In the episode, \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" attempts to regain viewers by introducing a new character named Poochie, whose voice is provided by Homer.  The episode is largely self-referential and satirizes the world of television production, fans of \"The Simpsons\", and the series itself.  It was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Steven Dean Moore.  Alex Rocco is a credited guest voice as Roger Meyers, Jr. for the third and final time (having previously provided the character's voice in \"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\" and \"The Day the Violence Died\"); Phil Hartman also guest stars as Troy McClure.

There have been at least four separate K9 units in the series, with the first two being companions of the Fourth Doctor.  Voice actor John Leeson has provided the character's voice in most of his appearances, except during Season 17 of \"Doctor Who\", in which David Brierley temporarily did so.

The story of this film had been acted on the stage by a young Minnie Maddern Fiske in the 1880s, one of her earliest successes as an adult actress.  The same story gives Pickford the chance to arise to the height of a fine actress instead of just merely a popular performer.  This film is lost."

    "question": "Douglas D. Scott is an American archaeologist most notable for his work at the site of a battle that occurred in what year? Context: David M. Pendergast: David Michael Pendergast, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (born 1934) is an American Archaeologist, and is most famous for his work at Altun Ha and Lamanai, Belize.  He received a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology in 1955 from the University of California, Berkeley, and earned his Ph.D. in 1961 at the University of California, Los Angeles, studying with Clement Meighan.  He was later married to Elizabeth Graham, also a Mesoamerican Archaeologist. Achilleion (Thessaly): Achilleion is an early Neolithic site in Thessaly, Greece.  It was partly excavated by the American archaeologist Marija Gimbutas.  Achilleion is a large site that is practically untouched by archaeologists which Gimbutas claims to be filled entirely with Neolithic debris and hundreds of Neolithic mounds.  An excavation was planned because the dig was expected to have a high yield of artifacts and if successful would possibly provide proof of an earlier age of European Neolithic settlement then was previously known.  Excavation was started because it was expected that they would find significant numbers of preceramic Neolithic remains.  The work started by Marija Gimbutas was stopped because the dig failed to yield any significant findings, but Gimbutas claims that the dig was interrupted by the political unrest caused by the Cyprus conflict. Douglas D. Scott: Douglas D. Scott is an American archaeologist most notable for his work at the Little Bighorn in the mid-1980s.  Working with Richard Fox, Melissa Connor, Doug Harmon, and staff and volunteers from the National Park Service, Scott worked to sketch out a field methodology that has enabled archaeologists to systematically investigate battlefields.  This work is internationally recognized as constituting a great step forward in our ability to interpret battlefields archaeologically, regardless of the extent of the historical record.  At the Little Bighorn, the fieldwork produced an interpretation of the battle that for the first time gave a clear understanding of the way the battle developed and pointed out some of the glaring inaccuracies of the historiography of the event.  The fieldwork also helped determine which of the 242 headstones to the 210 U.S. soldiers lost at the Little Bighorn were erroneous, and recovered skeletal elements allowed one of the soldiers to be positively identified.  It was not as successful in recovering the remains of 24 men lost in Deep Ravine and whose whereabouts are unknown to this day. Steven Collins (archaeologist): Steven Collins is an American archaeologist and a professor with the College of Archaeology at the unaccredited Trinity Southwest University in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an institution that states that biblical scripture is the \"divinely inspired representation of reality given by God to humankind, speaking with absolute authority in all matters upon which it touches\".

The site is approximately 30 km south of the larger site of Yaxchilan, under which Bonampak was a dependency, and the border with Guatemala.  While the site is not overly impressive in terms of spatial or architectural size (American archaeologist, epigrapher, and Mayanist scholar Sylvanus Morley once stated that Bonampak was fourth-rate in terms of size and political importance), it is well known for the murals located within the three roomed Structure 1 (\"The Temple of the Murals)\".  The construction of the site\u2019s structures dates to the Late Classic period (c. AD 580 to 800).  In addition to being amongst the most well-preserved Maya murals, the Bonampak murals are noteworthy for debunking early assumptions that the Maya were a peaceful culture of mystics (a position long-held and argued for by the well-known early Mesoamerican archaeologist, ethnohistorian and epigrapher from the Carnegie Institute of Washington, Sir John Eric Sidney Thompson), as the murals clearly depict war and human sacrifice. Waldo Rudolph Wedel: Waldo Rudolph Wedel (September 10, 1908 \u2013 August 27, 1996) was an American archaeologist and a central figure in the study of the prehistory of the Great Plains.  He was born in Newton, Kansas to a family of Mennonites.  In 1939 he married Mildred Mott, a fellow archaeologist and ethnohistorian.

    "question": "Did Billy Corgan's band The Smashing Pumpkins or Greek Fire originate in a more southern location? Context: 1979 (song): \"1979\" is a song by American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins.  Released in 1996 as the second single from their third studio album, \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\", \"1979\" was written by frontman Billy Corgan, and features loops and samples that were uncharacteristic of previous Smashing Pumpkins songs.  The song was written as a coming of age story by Corgan.  In the year 1979, Corgan was 12 and this is what he considered his transition into adolescence.  The song was popular with critics and fans; Allmusic's Amy Hanson called it a \"somewhat surprising hit\".  The song was nominated for the Record of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, and won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video.  In 2012, it was voted the second-best Smashing Pumpkins song by Rolling Stone magazine readers. Range Life (song): \"Range Life\" is a song by Pavement, the third single from their 1994 album \"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain\".  The song attracted attention with controversial lyrics that seemed to mock alternative rock superstars the Smashing Pumpkins and the Stone Temple Pilots; Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan expressed his displeasure in magazine interviews, while songwriter Stephen Malkmus maintained that his words had been misinterpreted and no insult was intended.  Regardless, Pavement, which was due to tour for Lollapalooza in 1994, got kicked out when the Smashing Pumpkins, the headlining act, threatened to cancel their Lollapalooza dates if Pavement played.  Pavement would eventually play Lollapalooza the next year.  An early 1993 demo of the song did not feature this verse; guitarist Spiral Stairs recalled in 2004 that when Malkmus first revealed these new lyrics to his bandmates at the New York City recording sessions for \"CRCR\", \"we almost lost our lunch from laughing so much.\"  The single was not commercially released in the USA; it was issued by the band's UK label at the time, Big Cat.  Both B-sides are outtakes from the \"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain\" sessions and are included on the 2004 of that album.

Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their quick demise, he released a solo album (\"TheFutureEmbrace\") and a collection of poetry (\"Blinking with Fists\") before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins.

The album would be Chamberlin's last with the band before his departure in 2009.  The album debuted strongly, but sales soon decreased, and critical reception was mixed.  It was certified Gold in the United States on February 1, 2008. Muzzle (song): \"Muzzle\" is a song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins from their third album, \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\".  It was one of the last songs written by Billy Corgan for \"Mellon Collie\", with the song's lyrics referring to what Corgan thought the public's perception was of him at the time.

Let There Be Love (1953 Joni James album): Let There Be Love is Joni James debut album, recorded in 1953 and released by MGM Records at the end of the year.  It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 33\u2153-rpm album.  The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world.  The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish.  The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale.  From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations.  Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released.  This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution.  Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas.  \"Let There Be Love\" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953.  In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album.  For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released.  That was \"I Need You Now,\" which was to have followed the hit \"My Love, My Love\" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's.  M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1.  For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get \"You're My Everything\" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play.  So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled.  In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release.  Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller.  Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order.  Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, \"Bossa Nova Style\", Joni included new recordings of several songs from \"Let There Be Love\", including a new single of \"You're Nearer.\"  That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chuck Sagle.  This information comes from Wayne Brasler, longtime President of the Joni James International Fan Club and the writer of the album notes for all Joni James' CD releases. Ian Partridge: Ian Partridge CBE (born 12 June 1938) is a retired English lyric tenor, whose repertoire ranged from Monteverdi, Bach and Handel, the Elizabethan lute songs, German, French and English songs, through to Schoenberg, Weill and Britten, and on to contemporary works.

The FIFA World Cup held every four years is the quintessential football event, combining the greatest players in the world and the passion of the fans.  Football has a long and glorious history, with which a vast and diverse culture has emerged.  The culture of football can be easily divided into how the players, fans and clubs see the sport."

    "question": "What kind of act does Whaling in Australia and Right whale have in common? Context: Right Whale Bay: Right Whale Bay is a bay 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide, entered between Craigie Point and Nameless Point along the north coast of South Georgia.  The name dates back to at least 1922 and is now well established.  The right whale is a species of whale found in this area \u2013 South Georgia was famous for its whaling.  It is linked to Morsa Bay by Ernesto Pass. Pygmy right whale: The pygmy right whale (\"Caperea marginata\") is a member of the cetotheres, a family of baleen whales, which until 2012 were thought to be extinct; previously \"C. marginata\" was considered the sole member of the family Neobalaenidae.  First described by John Edward Gray in 1846, it is the smallest of the baleen whales, ranging between 6 and in length and 3000 and in mass.  Despite its name, the pygmy right whale may have more in common with the gray whale and rorquals than the bowhead and right whales. Right whale: Right whales are three species of large baleen whales of the genus Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (\"E. glacialis\"), the North Pacific right whale (\"E. japonica\") and the Southern right whale (\"E. australis\").  They are classified in the family Balaenidae with the bowhead whale.  Right whales have rotund bodies with arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin.  The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough patches of skin on its head which appear white due to parasitism by whale lice.  Right whales can grow up to more than 18 m long with the maximum record of 19.8 m and weigh up to 100 ST or more; 20.7 m with 135000 kg or 21.3 m with uncertainty, being significantly larger than other coastal species such as humpbacks, grays, or eden's and omura's, but smaller than blues.  One (apocryphal) explanation for their name is that right whales were named by whalers who identified them as the \"right\" whale to kill on a hunt due to the plentiful oil and baleen they could provide. Southern right whale dolphin: The southern right whale dolphin (\"Lissodelphis peronii\") is a small and slender species of mammal found in cool waters of the Southern Hemisphere.  The dolphin is one of two species of right whale dolphin; \"Lissodelphis\", the other, the northern right whale dolphin, is found in deep oceans of the Northern Hemisphere. Balaenidae: Balaenidae is a family of whales of the parvorder Mysticeti that contains two living genera.  Historically, it is known as the right whale family, as it was thought to contain only species of right whales. Through most of the 20th Century, however, that became a much-debated (and unresolved) topic amongst the scientific community.  Finally, in the early 2000s, science reached a definitive conclusion: the bowhead whale, once commonly known as the Greenland right whale, was not in fact a right whale.  The family of Balaenids, therefore, comprises the right whales (genus \"Eubalaena\"), and in a genus all to its own, the very closely related bowhead whale (genus \"Balaena\"). North Atlantic right whale: The North Atlantic right whale (\"Eubalaena glacialis\", which means \"good, or true, whale of the ice\") is a baleen whale, one of three right whale species belonging to the genus \"Eubalaena\", all of which were formerly classified as a single species.  Because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produced high yields of whale oil), right whales were once a preferred target for whalers. Hermanus: Hermanus (originally called \"Hermanuspietersfontein\", but shortened in 1902 as the name was too long for the postal service ), is a town on the southern coast of the Western Cape province of South Africa.  It is famous for southern right whale watching during the southern winter and spring and is a popular retirement location.  The whales can be seen from the cliffs in the town centre as early as June and usually depart in early-December.  They were once hunted in the nearby town of Betty's Bay, but are now protected to ensure the survival of the species.  The Old Harbour Museum contains several exhibitions that explain the whaling industry, and the De Wetshuis Photo Museum houses an exhibition of photos by T. D. Ravenscroft that depicts the history of Hermanus.  The Whale Museum houses a skeleton of a whale and shows an audio-visual presentation of whales and dolphins twice daily. Whaling in New Zealand: Whaling in New Zealand dates back to the late 18th century, and ended in 1964 since it was no longer economic.  Nineteenth-century whaling was based on the southern right whale, and 20th-century whaling on the humpback whale.  There is now an established industry for whale watching based in the South Island town of Kaikoura. Right whale dolphin: Right whale dolphins are cetaceans belonging to the genus Lissodelphis.  It contains the northern right whale dolphin (\"Lissodelphis borealis\") and the southern right whale dolphin (\"Lissodelphis peronii\").  These cetaceans are predominantly black, white beneath, and one of the few without a dorsal fin or ridge.  They are smaller members of the delphinid family, oceanic dolphins, and very slender.  Despite scientists being long acquainted with the species (the Northern species was identified by Peale in 1848 and the Southern by La C\u00e9p\u00e8de in 1804), little is known about them in terms of life history and behaviour. History of Basque whaling: The Basques were among the first to catch whales commercially, and dominated the trade for five centuries, spreading to the far corners of the North Atlantic and even reaching the South Atlantic.  The French explorer Samuel de Champlain, when writing about Basque whaling in Terranova (i.e. Newfoundland), described them \"as the cleverest men at this fishing\".  By the early 17th century, other nations entered the trade in earnest, seeking the Basques as tutors, \"for [they] were then the only people who understand whaling\", lamented the English explorer Jonas Poole.  Having learned the trade themselves, other nations adopted their techniques and soon dominated the burgeoning industry \u2013 often to the exclusion of their former instructors.  Basque whaling peaked in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, but was in decline by the late 17th and early 18th centuries.  By the 19th century, it was moribund as the right whale was nearly extinct and the bowhead whale was decimated."

    "question": "Which comic book was also written by the writer of Crossed? Context: Comic book convention: A comic book convention or comic con is an event with a primary focus on comic books and comic book culture, in which comic book fans gather to meet creators, experts, and each other.  Commonly, comic conventions are multi-day events hosted at convention centers, hotels, or college campuses.  They feature a wide variety of activities and panels, with a larger number of attendees participating in cosplay than most other types of fan conventions. Comic book conventions are also used as a vehicle for industry, in which publishers, distributors, and retailers represent their comic-related releases.  Comic book conventions may be considered derivatives of science-fiction conventions, which began in the late 1930s. Comic book: A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes.  Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form.  Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s.  The first modern comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.  The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. Crossed (comics): Crossed is a comic book written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Jacen Burrows for the first ten issues, and published by Avatar Press.  Following volumes \"Crossed: Family Values\", \"Crossed 3D\", and \"Crossed: Psychopath\" were written by David Lapham.  A new series, \"Crossed: Badlands\" is written and drawn by rotating creative teams.  The franchise has also spawned two webcomics: \"Crossed: Wish You Were Here\", which ran from 2012\u20132014, and \"Crossed: Dead or Alive\", which began syndication in November 2014. Star Crossed (comics): Star Crossed, is a three-issue comic book mini-series published in 1997 under the short-lived DC Comics imprint, Helix.  Written and illustrated by Matt Howarth, \"Star Crossed\" recounts the surrealist tale of a deep-space romance between a genetically engineered \u00fcber-woman and a sentient asteroid.  Consistent with the performance of other Helix titles, \"Star Crossed\" failed to appeal to a broad readership and the poor sales figures which accompanied its publication coincided with a general downturn in the American comic book industry. Nunzio DeFilippis: Nunzio DeFilippis is an American writer of comic books and television.  He writes with his wife, Christina Weir, whom he met while they were both students at Vassar College.  The two have written for two seasons on HBO's \"Arli$$\", and have sold story ideas to the Disney Channel's \"Kim Possible\".  In comics, they have written several graphic novels and miniseries for independent publisher Oni Press, including \"Skinwalker, Three Strikes, Maria's Wedding, The Tomb, Once In A Blue Moon\" the Amy Devlin Mysteries, Frenemy Of The State (written with Rashida Jones), and Bad Medicine.  Their work at Oni led to work at Marvel Comics, relaunching the teen mutant book \"New Mutants\".  This book was renamed \"\".  Their run on these books spanned three years and created almost two dozen new super-powered mutant characters for Marvel's X-Men franchise, including Surge, Hellion, Wind Dancer, Prodigy, Wallflower, Elixir, Tag, Rockslide, Mercury, Anole, and Wither.  They have also written for DC Comics, with stories appearing in \"Wonder Woman, Adventures of Superman\" and \"Batman Confidential\" and Dark Horse with \"Dragon Age: Knight Errant.\"  The duo also work in the expanding field of Japanese manga, providing English adaptations for the Del Rey titles \"Guru-Guru Pon-Chan, Sugar Sugar Rune\" and \"Kagetora\".  They also write original English language manga for Seven Seas Entertainment, writing one of the company's launch titles, \"Amazing Agent Luna\" and the pirate manga, \"Destiny's Hand\".  DeFilippis also wrote, without his wife, an issue of DC Comics' \"Detective Comics\".

Metropolis was founded in 1984 by Stephen Fishler, and merged companies in 1999 with Vincent Zurzolo, Jr., of Vincent's Collectibles.; Zurzolo said that as he found he could not compete with Fishler's business, merging the two made sense.  The company is located on Broadway in New York City, and the comic book showroom allows viewings by appointment only.  Over the years, Metropolis Collectibles has grown from being a comic-book mail-order company to maintaining a major online retail presence.  In addition to being comic book buyers and comic book sellers, Metropolis also gives comic book appraisals and provides comic book valuation services of rare, old out-of-print comics.  Metropolis Collectibles has obtained a variety of notable classic comic book collections over the years, or \"pedigrees\", including the Crowley Collection, the Allentown Pedigree, the D-Copy Collection, and the Northford Collection.

Snapper Carr: Lucas \"Snapper\" Carr is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.  The character, whose fictional nickname is almost always used by other characters in favor of his given name, was created by Gardner Fox (writer) and Mike Sekowsky (penciller), and made his first appearance in \"The Brave and the Bold\" in February 1960.  From 1960 to 1969, Snapper Carr appeared as a supporting character to the Justice League of America, a superhero team.  The character occasionally appeared in comics featuring the Justice League from 1969 to 1989, when the \"Invasion! \" limited-series comic book gave him superpowers.  He was associated with a new superhero team, The Blasters, in various comics until 1993, when he lost his powers and became a main character in the \"Hourman\" comic book.  After the cancellation of \"Hourman\" in April 2001, he became a main character in the \"Young Justice\" comic book beginning in December 2001.  \"Young Justice\" was cancelled in May 2003, and he became associated with the governmental organization Checkmate, a role revealed when the character played a small but important role in the 2007-2008 limited series comic book \"52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen\".  The character made major appearances in \"Final Crisis: Resist\" in December 2008 and \"Justice League of America 80-Page Giant\" in November 2009."

    "question": "Which European based oil giant bought the commodities trading arm of J.P. Morgan in 2014? Context: Douglas Cliggott: Douglas \"Doug\" Cliggott (born 1956) is the U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.  He was appointed to that position in 2009.

Bank pool loan: A bank pool loan (BPL) is a fairly new form of loan, used by US based firms trading on public markets that need funding of under $10,000,000.  In a BPL, a group of European based banks (the pool), create a European firm whose sole purpose is to loan money to a US based company.  Because this loan to the European based bank is completely insured, the BPL does not have as high a risk if the loan is defaulted on.  Additionally, the pool actually makes more annual interest than if they were to loan money traditionally.  This allows US based firms to borrow as much as $10,000,000 completely interest free as long as it is backed by collateral of some sort (usually stock).  The Regulations require that the loan be of \"good value\" and so the newly formed European company usually requires securities to back the loan to pass this qualification. Esso Australia: Esso Australia is an Australian affiliate of ExxonMobil, the US based oil giant.

The boom was largely due to the rising demand from emerging markets such as the BRIC countries, particularly China during the period from 1992 to 2013, as well as the result of concerns over long-term supply availability.  There was a sharp down-turn in prices during 2008 and early 2009 as a result of the credit crunch and sovereign debt crisis, but prices began to rise as demand recovered from late 2009 to mid-2010.  Oil began to slip downwards after mid-2010, but peaked at $101.80 on 30 and 31 January 2011, as the Egyptian political crisis and rioting broke out, leading to concerns over both the safe use of the Suez Canal and overall security in Arabia itself.  On 3 March, Libya's National Oil Corp said that output had halved due to the departure of foreign workers.  As this happened, Brent Crude surged to a new high of above $116.00 a barrel as supply disruptions and potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa continued to worry investors.  Thus the price of oil kept rising into the 2010s.  The commodities super-cycle peaked in 2011, \"driven by a combination of strong demand from emerging nations and low supply growth.\"  Prior to 2002, only 5 to 10 per cent of trading in the commodities market was attributable to investors.  Since 2002 \"30 per cent of trading is attributable to investors in the commodities market\" which \"has caused higher price volatility.\""

Lysin: Lysins, also known as endolysins or murein hydrolases, are hydrolytic enzymes produced by bacteriophages in order to cleave the host's cell wall during the final stage of the lytic cycle.  Lysins are highly evolved enzymes that are able to target one of the five bonds in peptidoglycan (murein), the main component of bacterial cell walls, which allows the release of progeny virions from the lysed cell.  Cell-wall-containing Archaea are also lysed by specialized pseudomurein-cleaving lysins, while most archaeal viruses employ alternate mechanisms.  Similarly, not all bacteriophages synthesize lysins: some small single-stranded DNA and RNA phages produce membrane proteins that activate the host's autolytic mechanisms. Donald C. Paup: Donald Clark Paup (April 2, 1939 \u2013 August 7, 2012) was an American badminton player who won national and international titles from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s.

He was against literary critics who defined idealist intellectuals and philosophers of his time, and thought that Swedenborg, Hegel, Goethe, Fichte, Schelling, Schlegel and Hans Christian Andersen were all \"understood\" far too quickly by \"scholars\".

    "question": "Where did Henri Christophe and other slaves hold an uprising from 1791 to 1804 that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery and ruled by non-whites and former captives? Context: Henri Christophe: Henri Christophe (] ; 6 October 1767 \u2013 8 October 1820; used the anglicized version of Henry Christopher) was a former slave of Bambara ethnicity, and perhaps of Ibo descent, and key leader in the Haitian Revolution, which succeeded in gaining independence from France in 1804.  In 1805 he took part under Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the capturing of Santo Domingo (now Dominican Republic), against French forces who acquired the colony from Spain in the Treaty of Basel. State of Haiti: The State of Haiti (French: \u00c9tat d'Ha\u00efti, Haitian: Leta an Ayiti) was the name of the state in northern Haiti.  It was created on October 17, 1806 following the overthrow of the Empire of Haiti following the assassination of Emperor Jacques I.  The northern State of Haiti was ruled by Henri Christophe originally as \"Provisional Chief of the Haitian Government\" from October 17, 1806 until February 17, 1807 when he became \"President of the State of Haiti\".  The 1807 constitution for the State of Haiti made the post of president a position for life with the president having the power to appoint his successor.  On March 28, 1811 President Henri was proclaimed King Henry I, thereby dissolving the State of Haiti and creating the Kingdom of Haiti. Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re: The Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re or, Citadelle Henry Christophe, or simply the Citadelle (English: Citadel ), is a large mountaintop fortress in Nord, Haiti, located on top of the mountain Bonnet a L\u2019Eveque, approximately 17 mi south of the city of Cap-Ha\u00eftien, 10 mi southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area, and 5 mi uphill from the town of Milot.  It is one of the largest fortresses in the Americas and was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a World Heritage Site in 1982\u2014along with the nearby Sans-Souci Palace.  The mountaintop fortress has itself become an icon of Haiti.  The Citadel was built by Henri Christophe, a key leader during the Haitian slave rebellion (1791\u20131804), after Haiti gained independence from France at the beginning of the 19th century. Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci: Jean-Baptiste Sans-Souci was a leader of rebel slaves during the Haitian Revolution.  He was assassinated by rival black rebel leader, Henri Christophe, in 1803, shortly before Haiti won its independence.  Sans-Souci is notable as one of the most effective military leaders during the revolution, particularly against French forces led by Charles Leclerc in 1802 and 1803. Henri Christophe: A Chronicle in Seven Scenes: Henri Christophe: A Chronicle in Seven Scenes (1949) is the first play by Derek Walcott, written when he was 19 years old.  It is about the self-declared King Henri Christophe of Haiti, a former slave who became a general under Toussaint Louverture in the Haitian Revolution.  Later, he ruled the northern part of the nation from 1807 to 1820, first as president and from 1811 as king.  At the time the South was governed by the president Alexandre P\u00e9tion, a \"gens de couleur\" (free man of color; in Haiti, such people were generally of French and African descent). Haitian Revolution: The Haitian Revolution (French: \"R\u00e9volution ha\u00eftienne\" ] ) was a successful anti-slavery and anti-colonial insurrection by self-liberated slaves against French colonial rule in Saint-Domingue, now the sovereign nation of Haiti.  It began in 1791 and ended in 1804 with the former colony's independence.  It was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state, which was both free from slavery, and ruled by non-whites and former captives.  With the recent increase in Haitian Revolutionary Studies, it is now widely seen as a defining moment in the history of racism in the Atlantic World. Kingdom of Haiti: The Northern Kingdom of Haiti (French: Royaume d'Ha\u00efti, Haitian Creole: Ini an Ayiti) was the state established by Henri Christophe on 28 March 1811 when he was self-proclaimed as King Henri I after having previously ruled as president.  This was Haiti's second attempt at monarchical rule, as Jean-Jacques Dessalines had previously ruled over the Empire of Haiti.  Following the assassination of Emperor Jacques, the country was split.  Henri ruled over the north of the country as President of the State of Haiti and Alexandre P\u00e9tion, a free person of color, ruled as President of the Republic of Haiti in the south. Pomp\u00e9e Valentin Vastey: Pomp\u00e9e Valentin Vastey (1781 - 1820), or Pomp\u00e9e Valentin, Baron de Vastey, was a Haitian writer, educator, and politician.  Vastey was what people at the time called a \"mulatto,\" because he was born to a white French father and a black Haitian mother.  He served as secretary to King Henri Christophe and tutor to Christophe's son, Victor Henri.  Vastey also claimed to have fought in Toussaint\u2019s army and is said to have been the second cousin of the French novelist and playwright Alexandre Dumas (Daut 56; see also, Griggs 181).  Vastey is best known for his essays on the history and contemporary circumstances of Haiti. Slavery in Ethiopia: Slavery in Ethiopia existed for centuries.  The practice formed an integral part of Ethiopian society, from its earliest days through to the 20th century.  Slaves were traditionally drawn from the Nilotic groups inhabiting Ethiopia's southern hinterland.  War captives were another source of slaves, though the perception, treatment and duties of these prisoners was markedly different.  Slaves were also sold abroad as part of the Arab slave trade, serving as concubines, bodyguards, servants and treasurers.  In response to pressure by Western Allies of World War II, Ethiopia officially abolished slavery and involuntary servitude after having regained its independence in 1942.  On 26 August 1942, Haile Selassie issued a proclamation outlawing slavery. Fran\u00e7ois-Ferdinand Christophe: Fran\u00e7ois-Ferdinand Henri Christophe (1794 October 7, 1805) was the eldest son and first child of Field General Henri Christophe, future King of Haiti, and his wife, Marie-Louise Coidavid.  Because he was both born and died before his father's ascension as King, in 1811, he was never Prince Royal of Haiti, nor was he ever heir apparent to the throne."

It later expanded to include various radical socialist groups and community groups like the Lincoln Park Poor People's Coalition.  It was associated with the rising Black Power movement, which mobilized some African-American discontent and activism by other ethnic minority groups after the passage of the mid-1960s civil rights legislation under Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson. Hakim Jamal: Hakim Abdullah Jamal (March 28, 1931 \u2013 May 1, 1973) was the name adopted by African-American activist Allen Donaldson, who was a cousin of Malcolm X and later became an associate of Michael X.  Jamal wrote \"From the Dead Level\", a memoir of his life and memories of Malcolm X. African-American bookstores: African-American bookstores, also known as black bookstores, are bookstores owned and operated by African Americans.  These stores often, although not always, specialize in works by and about African Americans and their target customers are often African Americans.  Although they are a variety of African-American business, African American bookstores have often been closely tied to radical political movements including Marxism, Black Power, and pan-Africanism. The first documented African-American bookstore was established by the abolitionist David Ruggles in 1834.  One of the earliest African-American bookstores to achieve national prominence was Lewis Michaux's National Memorial African Bookstore, which operated in Harlem from the early 1930s to the middle of the 1970s.  Michaux's store doubled as a meeting place for black activists, including most famously Malcolm X.  The Black Power movement embraced black-owned bookstores in the 1960s and '70s as vehicles for promoting their ideology and creating radical political spaces in black communities across the United States.  By the 1990s, African-American bookstores earned significant attention from more politically moderate and business oriented media outlets such as the magazine Black Enterprise.  In the 2000s and 2010s, however, as independent bookstores of all kinds declined and bookstores chains and Amazon increasingly sold black-authored books, the number of African-American bookstores declined rapidly, dropping from over 250 to just over 70. Black Arts Movement: The Black Arts Movement, Black Aesthetics Movement or BAM is the artistic outgrowth of the Black Power movement that was prominent in the 1960s and early 1970s. \" Time\" magazine describes the Black Arts Movement as the \"single most controversial movement in the history of African-American literature\u00a0\u2013 possibly in American literature as a whole.\"  The Black Arts Repertory Theatre is a key institution of the Black Arts Movement. Black Power Revolution: The Black Power Revolution, also known as the \"Black Power Movement\", 1970 Revolution, Black Power Uprising and February Revolution, was an attempt by a number of social elements, people and interest groups in Trinidad and Tobago to force socio-political change. Black Power movement: The Black Power movement was a political movement to achieve a form of Black Power and the many philosophies it contains.  The movement saw various forms of activism some violent and some peaceful, all hoping to achieve black empowerment.  The Black Power movement also represented socialist movements, all with the general motivation of improving the standing of black people in society.  Originated during the Civil Rights Movement, some doubted the philosophy of the movement begging for more radical action, taking influences from Malcolm X.  The cornerstone of the movement was the Black Panther Party, a Black Power organization dedicated to socialism and the use of violence to achieve it.  The Black Power movement developed amidst the criticisms of the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s, and over time and into the 1970s, the movement grew and became more violent.  After years of violence, many left the movement and the police began arresting violent actors in the movement.  The Black Power movement also spilled out into the Caribbean creating the Black Power Revolution. Tommie Smith: Tommie C.

By the time he left prison, Knight had prepared a second volume featuring his own writings and works of his fellow inmates.  This second book, first published in Italy under the title \"Voce negre dal carcere,\" appeared in English in 1970 as \"Black Voices from Prison\".  These works established Knight as one of the major poets of the Black Arts Movement, which flourished from the early 1960s through the mid-1970s.  With roots in the Civil Rights Movement, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, and the Black Power Movement, Etheridge Knight and other American artists within the movement sought to create politically engaged work that explored the African-American cultural and historical experience.

    "question": "Which man, Ibn Tufail or Ali Qushji, is best known for the development of astronomical physics independent from natural philosophy? Context: History of physics: Physics (from the Ancient Greek \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \"physis\" meaning \"nature\") is the fundamental branch of science that developed out of the study of nature and philosophy known, until around the end of the 19th century, as \"natural philosophy\".  Today, physics is ultimately defined as the study of matter, energy and the relationships between them.  Physics is, in some senses, the oldest and most basic pure science; its discoveries find applications throughout the natural sciences, since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world.  The other sciences are generally more limited in their scope and may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right.  Physics today may be divided loosely into classical physics and modern physics. John Dumbleton: John of Dumbleton (Latin \"Ioannes De Dumbleton\"; c. 1310\u00a0\u2013 c. 1349) was a member of the Dumbleton village community in Gloucestershire, a southwestern county in England.  Although obscure, he is considered a significant English fourteenth-century philosopher for his contributions to logic, natural philosophy, and physics.  Dumbleton\u2019s masterwork is his \"Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis\" (Summary of Logic and Natural Philosophy), likely to have been composed just before the time of his death. Ibn Zuhr: Ibn Zuhr (Arabic: \u200e \u200e ; 1094\u20131162), traditionally known by his Latinized name of Avenzoar, was a Muslim Arab physician and surgeon and poet.  He was born at Seville in medieval Andalusia (present-day Spain), was a contemporary of Averroes and Ibn Tufail, and was the most well-regarded physician of his era.  He was particularly known for his emphasis on a more rational, empiric basis of medicine.  His major work, \"Al-Tays\u012br fil-Mud\u0101w\u0101t wal-Tadb\u012br\" (\"Book of Simplification Concerning Therapeutics and Diet\"), was translated into Latin and Hebrew and was influential to the progress of surgery.  He also improved surgical and medical knowledge by keying out several diseases and their treatments. Henry Draper Medal: The Henry Draper Medal is awarded every 4 years by the United States National Academy of Sciences \"for investigations in astronomical physics\".  Named after Henry Draper, the medal is awarded with a gift of USD $15,000.  The medal was established under the Draper Fund by his widow, Anna Draper, in honor of her husband, and was first awarded in 1886 to Samuel Pierpont Langley \"for numerous investigations of a high order of merit in solar physics, and especially in the domain of radiant energy\".  It has since been awarded 45 times.  The medal was most recently awarded in 2013 to William J. Borucki \"For his founding concept, unflagging advocacy, and visionary leadership during the development of NASA's Kepler mission, which has uncovered myriad planets and solar systems with unforeseen and surprising properties.\" .

The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the Peripatetic school and later on by the Neoplatonists, who produced many commentaries on Aristotle's writings.  In the Islamic Golden Age, Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd translated the works of Aristotle into Arabic and under philosophers such as Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna and Averroes, Aristotelianism became a major part of early Islamic philosophy.

As a disciple of Ulugh Beg, he is best known for the development of astronomical physics independent from natural philosophy, and for providing empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation in his treatise, \"Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy\".  In addition to his contributions to Ulugh Beg's famous work Zij-i-Sultani and to the founding of Sahn-\u0131 Seman Medrese, one of the first centers for the study of various traditional Islamic sciences in the Ottoman caliphate, Ali Ku\u015f\u00e7u was also the author of several scientific works and textbooks on astronomy.

It was one of the highest educational facilities of various sciences such as theology, law, medicine, astronomy, physics and mathematics, and was founded by the Turk astronomer Ali Qushji who was invited by the Ottoman sultan Fatih Sultan Mehmed to his court in Istanbul. Hayy ibn Yaqdhan: \u1e24ayy ibn Yaq\u1e93\u0101n (Arabic: \u062d\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0638\u0627\u0646\u200e \u200e \"\"Alive, son of Awake\"\"; Latin: \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" \"\"The Self-Taught Philosopher\"\"; English: The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ), the first Arabic novel, was written by Ibn Tufail (also known as \"Aben Tofail\" or \"Ebn Tophail\"), a Arab philosopher and physician, in early 12th century Islamic Spain.

Parkridge, Saskatoon: Parkridge is a residential community in western Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, located on land annexed by the city between 1975 and 1979.  Development of the subdivision (initially called \"Fairhaven II\" after the neighbouring community to the east, began in the early 1980s.  The extreme west end of the neighbourhood remained undeveloped until the subsequent creation of the adjacent Blairmore Suburban Centre led to the final phase of Parkridge being built out in the early 2010s.  Whereas the majority of residents are employed in the sales and service sector, the next highest employer is business, finance and administration.  The two main age groups are those in their 40s and teenagers as of 2005.  Until recently Parkridge was the farthest western neighbourhood of Saskatoon south of 22nd Street.  However, new construction will soon see Neighbourhood 2 of the Blairmore SDA bear that claim to fame.  In comparison, the neighbourhood of Parkridge with a 2001 census population of 4,505 is larger than the Saskatchewan city of Melville which had a population of 4,149 in 2006, and 4,453 in 2001 and Parkridge is a little smaller than the provincial city of Humboldt which was 4,998 in 2006, and 5,161 in 2001.

They were remapped in 1912\u201313 by Captain Petter Sorlle, and in 1933 by Discovery Investigations personnel on the RSS \"Discovery II\", who named them for William S. Bruce, the leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, 1902\u201304. Smith Rocks: Smith Rocks ( ) is a group of rocks lying 0.5 nmi northeast of Canopus Islands, 0.5 nmi west of Kitney Island, 2 nmi southwest of Wiltshire Rocks, and 3 nmi northwest of Paterson Islands, in the east part of Holme Bay, Mac.  Robertson Land.  Mapped by Norwegian cartographers from air photos taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition, 1936\u201337, and named Spjotoyholmane.  Renamed by Antarctic Names Committee of Australia (ANCA) for Captain V. Smith, RAASC, DUKW driver who took part in ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) changeover operations at Davis and Mawson stations in 1958-59 and 1959-60. Kitney Island: Kitney Island is a small island 1 nmi east-northeast of the Smith Rocks, 1 nmi southwest of the Wiltshire Rocks, and 2.5 nmi northwest of the Paterson Islands, off the coast of Mac.  Robertson Land, Antarctica.  The Lars Christensen Expedition (1936) first mapped this island which, though left unnamed, was included in a small group named by them \"Spjotoyskjera\" (now the Wiltshire Rocks).  It was remapped by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) in 1956, and was named by the Antarctic Names Committee of Australia for V.J. Kitney, a supervising technician (radio) at Mawson Station in 1968. Glacier Ridge: Glacier Ridge ( ) is a broad north\u2013south ridge, 4.5 nmi long and 0.8 nmi wide, on the southern slopes of Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica.

    "question": "Ciril Cvetko is the brother of a scholar who participates in what analysis of music? Context: Time\u2013frequency analysis for music signals: Time\u2013frequency analysis for music signals is one of the applications of time\u2013frequency analysis.  Musical sound can be more complicated than human vocal sound, occupying a wider band of frequency.  Music signals are time-varying signals; while the classic Fourier transform is not sufficient to analyze them, time\u2013frequency analysis is an efficient tool for such use.  Time\u2013frequency analysis is extended from the classic Fourier approach.  Short-time Fourier transform (STFT), Gabor transform (GT) and Wigner distribution function (WDF) are famous time\u2013frequency methods, useful for analyzing music signals such as notes played on a piano, a flute or a guitar.

    "question": "How did Emilie du Chatelet, Voltaire's love, contribute to the basic laws of physics? Context: Environmental policy in China: Environmental policy in China is set by the National People's Congress and managed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China.  The Center for American Progress has described China's environmental policy as similar to that of the United States before 1970.  That is, the central government issues fairly strict regulations, but the actual monitoring and enforcement is largely undertaken by local governments that have greater interest in economic growth.  The environmental work of non-governmental forces, such as lawyers, journalists, and non-governmental organizations, is limited by government regulations.  Under the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China, the Department of Policies, Laws and Regulations is in charge of establishing and strengthening basic laws and policies such as environmental laws, administrative policies and economical regulations.  It is also responsible for the development of national environmental protection policy and macro strategy. Basic Laws of Israel: The Basic Laws of Israel (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3\u200e \u200e , \"\u0127uqey ha-yesod\") are the constitutional laws of the State of Israel.  These laws deal with the formation and role of the principal institutions of the state, and with the relations between the state's authorities.  They also protect civil rights, although some of these rights were earlier protected at common law by the Supreme Court of Israel.  The Basic Laws are intended to be draft chapters of the future Israeli constitution, postponed since 1950, and act as a \"de facto\" constitution until their future incorporation into a formal, unitary, written constitution.  Israel as of 2017 functions according to an uncodified constitution consisting of both material constitutional law, based upon cases and precedents, common law, and the provisions of these formal statutes.  The Basic Laws do not cover all constitutional issues, and there is no deadline set for the completion of the process of merging them into one comprehensive constitution.  There is no clear rule determining the precedence of Basic Rules over regular legislation, and in many cases this issue is left to interpretation by the judicial system. Katherine Kath: Katherine Kath (11 August 1920 \u2013 17 November 2012) was a French prima ballerina at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, who became an actress after suffering from an injury which destroyed her chances of continuing her career.  She was born Lily Faess in Berck, Pas-de-Calais, France, where she also died, at age 92 in 2012 from undisclosed causes. Jean de Chastelet: Jean du Chatelet, also known as Baron de Beausoleil and Auffembach (1578, Brabant \u2013 c. 1645, The Bastille, Paris), was a mineralogist, mining engineer and dowser. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet: Gabrielle \u00c9milie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise Du Ch\u00e2telet (] ; 17 December 1706 \u00a0\u2013 10 September 1749) was a French natural philosopher, mathematician, physicist, and author during the early 1730s until her untimely death due to childbirth in 1749.  Her most recognized achievement is her translation of and commentary on Isaac Newton's book \"Principia\" containing basic laws of physics.  The translation, published posthumously in 1759, is still considered the standard French translation today.  Her commentary includes a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics\u2014the postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element. The Physics of Superheroes: The Physics of Superheroes is a popular science book by physics professor and long-time comic-book fan James Kakalios.  First published in 2005, it explores the basic laws of physics.  Kakalios does not set out to show where the world of superheroes contradicts modern science, granting the heroes one or more \"miracle exceptions\" from natural law.  Instead, he focuses on examples of comic book scenes that can be used to understand the diverse laws of physics from an unusual angle, such as Gwen Stacy's death and Ant-Man's ability to punch his way out of a paper bag.  Kakalios relates these elements of comic books to principles of physics, such as levers and torque, and in this way covers diverse topics, from mechanics to the quantum world. Ethiopian Legal Information Website: The Ethiopian Legal Information Website is an online database of laws in Ethiopia.  It aims to provide the public, researchers, professors, law firms and legal professionals access to the basic laws on the web and other digital formats.  It was developed by Mekelle University Law Faculty in Ethiopia in cooperation with the Non-Western Law Department of Ghent University in Belgium.  While it contains only the laws of the federal government at this moment, it plans adding state, regional and other laws. Laws of association: The principal laws of association are contiguity, repetition, attention, pleasure-pain, and similarity.  The basic laws were formulated by Aristotle in approximately 300 B.C. and by John Locke in the seventeenth century.  Both philosophers taught that the mind at birth is a blank slate and that all knowledge has to be acquired by learning.  The laws they taught still make up the backbone of modern learning theory. 12 basic principles of animation: Disney's Twelve Basic Principles of Animation were introduced by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their 1981 book \"\".  Johnston and Thomas in turn based their book on the work of the leading Disney animators from the 1930s onwards, and their effort to produce more realistic animations.  The main purpose of the principles was to produce an illusion of characters adhering to the basic laws of physics, but they also dealt with more abstract issues, such as emotional timing and character appeal. Constitution of Israel: The State of Israel has an unwritten constitution.  Instead of a formal written constitution, and in accordance with the Harari Decision (\u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05e8\u05d9) of 13 June 1950 adopted during the Israeli Constituent Assembly, the State of Israel has enacted several Basic Laws of Israel dealing with the government arrangements and with human rights.  The Israeli Supreme Court President Aharon Barak ruled that the Basic Laws should be considered the state's constitution, and that became the common approach throughout his tenure (1995-2006).  Opponents of this approach include Barak's colleague, Judge of the Supreme Court Mishael Cheshin."

Cadet branch: In history and heraldry, a cadet branch consists of the male-line descendants of a monarch or patriarch's younger sons (cadets).  In the ruling dynasties and noble families of much of Europe and Asia, the family's major assets\u2014realm, titles, fiefs, property and income\u2014have historically been passed from a father to his firstborn son in what is known as primogeniture; younger sons\u2014cadets\u2014inherited less wealth and authority to pass to future generations of descendants. Line of succession to the former Egyptian throne: Under the Muhammad Ali dynasty, the line of succession to the former Egyptian throne was subject to a number of changes during its history.  From its founding in 1805 until 1866, the dynasty followed the imperial Ottoman practice of agnatic seniority, whereby the eldest male in any generation would succeed to the throne.  In 1866, however, the then Khedive of Egypt Isma'il Pasha obtained a \"firman\" from the Ottoman Emperor which restricted the succession to the male-line descendants of Isma'il Pasha.  The resulting succession remained in force until the abolition of the Egyptian monarchy in 1953, following the 1952 Egyptian Revolution. Batonishvili: Batonishvili (Georgian: \u10d1\u10d0\u10e2\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 ) (literally \"a child of batoni (lord or sovereign)\" in Georgian) is a title for royal princes and princesses who descend from the kings of Georgia from the Bagrationi dynasty and is suffixed to the names e.g. Alexandre Batonishvili, Ioane Batonishvili, Nino Batonishvili etc.  The title was eventually borne not only by the children of the reigning king (\"mepe\"), but by all male-line descendants of past kings.

It was re-created by Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria on 14 November 1817 and awarded to his son-in-law Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais.  Eug\u00e8ne was the adopted stepson of the deposed Emperor Napoleon I of France, and Eug\u00e8ne had been his heir in Frankfurt and briefly in Italy.  King Maximilian Joseph compensated his son-in-law after he lost his other titles and named him heir to the kingdom after the male-line descendants of the royal house and next in precedence after the Royal Family.

It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty \u2013 itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians.  Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \"Capetian\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet.  It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France).  They were sometimes called \"the third race of kings\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second.  The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \"Hugh Capet\".

They were succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution."

International expansion of Netflix: The company first began offering streaming service to the international market on September 22, 2010 to Canada.  At the time, Canadians could subscribe to Netflix for $7.99 a month, a rate that CEO Hastings called, \"the lowest, most aggressive price we've ever had anywhere in the world.\"  However, despite the proclaimed low price, content selection in Canada was extremely limited.  In 2012, data conducted by Josh Loewen for Canadian Business Online found that in the United States there were 10,625 unique titles in Netflix's library, whereas in Canada there were only 2,647.  This could be blamed on differences in distribution deals in the United States and Canada.  It is important to point out that from its beginning, Canadian Netflix has offered content not available in the United States.  For example, a short-lived Fox sitcom, \"Running Wilde\" starring Keri Russell and Will Arnett, began streaming on Canadian Netflix the same day it began airing in the United States on network television.  The show streamed on Canadian Netflix because there was no Canadian broadcast partner, but was not available on US Netflix \u2013 becoming deemed a \"Canada-only exclusive\".  Still, regardless of a limited streaming selection, it took the company less than a year to reach one million subscribers, approximately three percent of Canada's population.  Further, as of February 2014, there were approximately 5.8 million Canadians using Netflix, or 29% of Canada's English speaking population.  This number represents an increase in Canadian users by approximately 40% since 2012.

The song was featured in the Blue \u00d6yster Cult album \"Cult\u00f6saurus Erectus.\"  When Bloom was asked how he got in touch with Moorcock for the song he claims, \"I went out of my way to send him a Fan Boy letter.  He was living in England, and he came over to America, to meet with his publisher.  He said, \u201cLet's get together.\u201d  We got together, and bonded, and he started sending me lyrics.

Moving map display: A moving map display is a type of navigation system output that, instead of numerically displaying the current geographical coordinates determined by the navigation unit or an heading and distance indication of a certain waypoint, displays the unit's current location at the center of a map.  As the unit moves around and new coordinates are therefore determined, the map moves to keep its position at the center of the display.  Mechanical moving map displays using paper charts were first introduced in the 1950s, and became common in some roles during the 1960s.  Mechanically moved paper maps were replaced by digital maps during the 1970s and 80s, with resolution and detail improving along with computer imagery and the computer memory systems that held the data.  A common example of a moving map display today is the map display in a smart phone, which uses GPS to determine its current position and then recalls the map data from the device's memory or from the Internet in real time.

    "question": "What are the anchor stores for the shopping mall constructed by C.J. Segerstrom & Sons in California?   Context: The Galleria at Fort Lauderdale: The Galleria at Fort Lauderdale is an upscale shopping mall in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  It was originally the \"Sunrise Center\", an open-air shopping mall constructed in 1954, but was demolished except for the Jordan Marsh anchor store that is now Dillard's and rebuilt as an enclosed mall.  The Galleria opened in three phases, initially on November 11, 1980 with Burdines (now Macy's) and Saks Fifth Avenue (now H&M and Regus), second in 1982 featuring Neiman Marcus, and lastly in 1983 with Lord & Taylor. North Shore Square: North Shore Square is a 621192 sqft shopping mall in Slidell, Louisiana.  The mall is the largest mall on the Northshore of Lake Pontchartrain, fifth largest in the New Orleans area and the 11th largest in Louisiana.  The mall is home to two anchor stores, Dillard's, and At Home, as well as approximately 23 other stores.  All the anchor stores are on one level.  The mall did not flood during Hurricane Katrina and experienced no serious damage.  The mall formerly had Mervyns as an anchor store, but closed shortly after the storm when Mervyn's pulled out of the Louisiana market.  The store was eventually replaced by Burlington Coat Factory, which is now closed due to corporate downsizing.  JCPenney closed on July 31, 2017.  The mall has struggled partially due to increased internet-based sales as well as an open-air shopping center located on the opposite side of town, to which it lost some of its tenants.  Following a nationwide trend, the mall's future is uncertain as many former mall-based stores have either closed completely or downsized nationally, and enclosed shopping malls across the country are challenged by new consumer trends and shifting paradigms. C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons: C J Segerstrom & Sons is a family business incorporated as a major real estate company in Orange County (along with the Irvine Company and the O'Neill family), especially in the city of Costa Mesa.

The enormous shopping mall is one of the highest grossing in the country, with over 300 stores and around one and a half billion dollars in annual sales.  The family's monetary donations provided for the construction of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, on land also donated by the family/company.  Besides the performing arts center the family/company gives heavily to the local Newport-Mesa school district.  The family also owns land rights to much of the expanding commercial office space around the mall.  Though they have sold the property rights to the residential areas south of the 405 Freeway, they still hold the mineral rights.

The survivors of the ground echelon fought as infantry during Battle of Bataan and after their surrender, were subjected to the Bataan Death March, although some did escape to Australia.  The remainder of the air echelon fought in the Dutch East Indies campaign (1942) before being reassigned to other units.  The squadron was never remanned or equipped.  It was carried as an active unit until April 2, 1946. 74th Bombardment Squadron: The 74th Bombardment Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit.

Battle of Bataan: The Battle of Bataan (7 January \u2013 9 April 1942) represented the most intense phase of Imperial Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II.  In January 1942, forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy invaded Luzon along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.  The commander-in-chief of all Filipino and American forces in the islands, General Douglas MacArthur, consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese invaders.  By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia.  The Bataan peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region.  Despite a lack of supplies, Filipino and American forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward.  As the combined Filipino and American forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific.  The surrender at Bataan, with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether, was the largest in American and Filipino military histories, and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War's Battle of Harper's Ferry.  Soon afterwards, Filipino and American prisoners of war were forced into the Bataan Death March. William E.

It is part of the northern fringe of the Nellis Range, measuring 625 sqmi .  Tonopah Test Range is located about 70 mi northwest of Groom Dry Lake, the home of the Area 51 facility.  Like the Groom Lake facility, Tonopah is a site of interest to conspiracy theorists, mostly for its use of experimental and classified aircraft.  As such, it is not the focus of alien enthusiasts, unlike its neighbor.  It is currently used for nuclear weapons stockpile reliability testing, research and development of fusing and firing systems, and testing nuclear weapon delivery systems.  The airspace comprises restricted area R-4809 of the Nevada Test and Training Range and is often used for military training. Nashville Terminal Subdivision: The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. San Gabriel River (Texas): The San Gabriel River is a river that flows through central Texas.  The San Gabriel River is formed in Georgetown, Texas by the confluence of the North Fork San Gabriel and the South Fork San Gabriel, both of which originate in Burnet County.

Both are U.S. Army Corps of Engineers impoundments.  The San Gabriel River joins the Little River five miles south of Cameron when then meets the Brazos River northwest of College Station.  There is a city park in Georgetown at the confluence of the North and South Forks, with a well-known local swimming spot (the \"Blue Hole\") located just upriver from the confluence on the South Fork. Groom Lake (salt flat): Groom Lake is a salt flat in Nevada used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (KXTA).  It is located immediately north of the Area 51 USAF installation.  The lake at 4409 ft elevation is approximately 3.7 mi from north to south and 3 mi from east to west at its widest point, and is approximately 11.3 miles in circumference.  Located within the namesake Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, the lake is 25 mi south of Rachel, Nevada."

Sherman, who also provided the general layout, cover art and graphic design for the book.  Other than certain pages in the \"My Time\" photographic sections of \"Moose,\" (which were completed after the author's death on March 6, 2012) the majority of the book, including its innovative arrangement of chapters, was created during the author's lifetime and under his personal supervision.  \"Moose\" was published by AuthorHouse Publishers of Bloomington, Indiana in association with AuthorSolutions, Penguin Random House Company affiliates.

Although early \"mock-up\" versions of the book were circulated among Sherman's close friends and members of his family in 2004, according to the editor's introductory chapter, \"About Moose\", mass publication had to be delayed \"for reasons too cumbersome to delve into here.\"  Both the book and its author were credited in the 2013 Walt Disney film release, \"Saving Mr. Banks\" which starred Academy Award winning actors Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks.

Dibao (ancient Chinese gazette): Dibao (), literally \"reports from the [official] residences\", were a type of publications issued by central and local governments in imperial China.  While closest in form and function to gazettes in the Western world, they have also been called \"palace reports\" or \"imperial bulletins\".  Different sources place their first publication as early as the Han Dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 AD) or as late as the Tang Dynasty (June 18, 618\u2013June 4, 907).  They contained official announcements and news, and were intended to be seen only by bureaucrats (and a given \"dibao\" might only be intended for a certain subset of bureaucrats).  Selected items from a gazette might then be conveyed to local citizenry by word of mouth and/or posted announcements.  Frequency of publication varied widely over time and place.  Before the invention of moveable type printing they were hand-written or printed with engraved wooden blocks.  The introduction of European-style Chinese language newspapers, along with the growing intersection of Chinese and global affairs generally, applied pressure for the Dibao to adapt, and circulation of the \"Beijing Gazette\" was in the tens of thousands by the time publication ceased altogether with the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911.  The gazettes from Beijing at this time were known as \"Jingbao\" (\u4eac\u5831), literally \"reports from the capital\"."

    "question": "What is a common feature of both the Iron Rattler's inversion and a barrel roll? Context: Negative inversion: In linguistics, negative inversion is one of many types of subject-auxiliary inversion in English.  A negation (e.g. \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", \"nothing\", etc.) or a word that implies negation (\"only\", \"hardly\", \"scarcely\") or a phrase containing one of these words precedes the finite auxiliary verb necessitating that the subject and finite verb undergo inversion.  Negative inversion is a phenomenon of English syntax.  The V2 word order of other Germanic languages does not allow one to acknowledge negative inversion as a specific phenomenon, since their V2 principle, which is mostly absent from English, allows inversion to occur much more often than in English.  While negative inversion is a common occurrence in English, a solid understanding of just what elicits the inversion has not yet been established.  It is, namely, not entirely clear why certain fronted expressions containing a negation elicit negative inversion, but others do not. Adrian &quot;Wildman&quot; Cenni: Adrian \"Wildman\" Cenni is a professional off-road truck racer, professional stunt man, and President/Founder of Atrium Staffing.  Cenni is the first person to successfully land a true 360 degree barrel roll in a vehicle. Aileron roll: The aileron roll is an aerobatic maneuver in which an aircraft does a full 360\u00b0 revolution about its longitudinal axis.  When executed properly, there is no appreciable change in altitude and the aircraft exits the maneuver on the same heading as it entered.  This is commonly one of the first maneuvers taught in basic aerobatics courses.  The aileron roll is commonly confused with a barrel roll. Phallic processions: Phallic processions, or Penis Parade, called \"phallika\" in ancient Greece, were a common feature of Dionysiac celebrations; they were processions that advanced to a cult center, and were characterized by obscenities and verbal abuse.  The display of a fetishized phallus was a common feature.  In a famous passage in chapter 3.3 of the \"Poetics\", Aristotle formulated the hypothesis that the earliest forms of comedy originated and evolved from \"those who lead off the phallic processions\", which were still common in many towns at his time. Muzzle brake: A muzzle brake or recoil compensator is a device connected to the muzzle of a firearm or cannon that redirects propellant gases to counter recoil and unwanted rising of the barrel during rapid fire.  The concept was first introduced for artillery and was a common feature on many anti-tank guns, especially those mounted on tanks, in order to reduce the area needed to take up the strokes of recoil and kickback.  They have been used in various forms for rifles and pistols to help control recoil and the rising of the barrel that normally occurs after firing.  They are used on pistols for practical pistol competitions, and are usually called compensators in this context. Operation Barrel Roll: Operation \"Barrel Roll\" was a covert U.S. Air Force 2nd Air Division (later the Seventh Air Force) and U.S. Navy Task Force 77, interdiction and close air support campaign conducted in the Kingdom of Laos between 14 December 1964 and 29 March 1973 concurrent with the Vietnam War. El Rollo: An El Rollo (Spanish for \"The Roll\") is a bodyboarding trick performed when the bodyboarder hits the lip of the wave and uses its power to throw himself out with the lip in a perfect arc to complete a roll before landing on the wave surface or into the white water.  When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the wave surface or the lip the trick is called an \"air roll\" or \"aerial roll\".  Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave.  This trick was named by someone in the industry.  I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\".  Photos of the new move and captions started appearing in Bodyboarding Magazine.  The move and the term caught on and spread around the world. Iron Rattler: Iron Rattler is a steel roller coaster located at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio, Texas.  The ride opened in 2013, replacing The Rattler, a wooden roller coaster, by putting a new steel track on top of The Rattler's wooden support structure.  The distance between the lowest and highest points of the first drop was increased from 124 to and the drop was made steeper by changing the angle to 81 degrees.  The resulting modifications increased the speed of the trains from 65 to .  It is the first hybrid wood and steel roller coaster to feature an inversion, in which riders are turned upside-down and then back upright.  The inversion is a zero-g-roll, which is when the train goes through a combination of a loop and a roll. Barrel roll: A barrel roll is an aerial maneuver in which an airplane makes a complete rotation on both its longitudinal and lateral axes, causing it to follow a helical path, approximately maintaining its original direction.  It is sometimes described as a \"combination of a loop and a roll.\"  The g-force is kept positive (but not constant) on the object throughout the maneuver, commonly between 2\u20133 g, and no less than 0.5 g.  The barrel roll is commonly confused with an aileron roll. Barrel roll (disambiguation): A barrel roll is a vehicle maneuver mostly done in aircraft."

RCAF Western Air Command: Western Air Command was the part of the Royal Canadian Air Force's Home War Establishment responsible for air operations on the Pacific coast of Canada during the Second World War.  When Canada declared war against Germany in September 1939 the command consisted of only five squadrons.  Four of them equipped with obsolete aircraft including a bomber squadron with aircraft from the Great War and there were no fighter aircraft at all for its only fighter squadron (113 Fighter Squadron was thus disbanded).  With the Japanese threat after Pearl Harbor it grew rapidly and played a critical role in fighter and anti-submarine operations in Canadian and American waters during the Aleutian Islands Campaign.  It was there that Squadron Leader K.A. Boomer of No. 111 Squadron shot down a Rufe fighter, the RCAF's only kill in the Pacific Theatre.  On 7 July 1942 a Bristol Bolingbroke pressed home an attack on the Japanese Submarine Ro 32 the pilot F/Sgt.  P.M.G. Thomas of No. 115 Squadron RCAF then led American Destroyers to sink the damaged submarine.  By January 1943 Western Air Command had expanded to include many bomber, fighter and operational units under its control.  By the end of the war the command would involve some twenty squadrons when the last units to join were added in 1943.  These were the 163 Army Cooperation Squadron in March flying Bristol Bolingbrokes and Hawker Hurricanes, in May the 160 Bomber-Reconnaissance Squadron was added flying Cansos from Sea Island BC (before moving to Yarmouth NS in July) and the 166 Communication Squadron formed in September flying various types.  In addition to the new squadrons, new aircraft types came on line replacing the command's remaining Supermarine Stranraers and Blackburn Sharks with Canso's and the Bolingbrokes and Beauforts with the Lockheed Ventura.  Countless training missions and operational patrols bolstered the air activity over the coastal areas but there was not much action until RCAF Western Command was on the look out for General Kusaba's Fire Balloons that the Japanese called the F\u016bsen Bakudan Campaign.  In February and March 1945, P-40 fighter pilots from 133 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force operating out of RCAF Patricia Bay (Victoria, British Columbia), intercepted and destroyed two fire balloons, On 21 February, Pilot Officer E. E. Maxwell While shot down a balloon, which landed on Sumas Mountain, in Washington State.  On 10 March, Pilot Officer J. O. Patten destroyed a balloon near Saltspring Island, British Columbia.

With the end of the war in Europe these aircraft were joined by a number of Victory Aircraft Lancaster X bombers which were to be used to train the British Commonwealth's Very Long Range Bomber Tiger Force that would soon be sent to bomb the Japanese mainland from Okinawa.  With the unconditional surrender of Japan the RCAF's Tiger Force bomber squadrons were disbanded before they flew overseas and the total draw down of the Western Air Command was suddenly undertaken.  Within several months almost all the flying squadrons would be completely stood down. 69th Fighter Squadron: The 69th Fighter Squadron (69 FS) is a United States Air Force Reserve fighter squadron.

It was cut in 1999 to celebrate the forthcoming third millennium, and is based on a design of another white horse hill figure, which was also known as the Devizes White Horse, or sometimes The Snobs Horse, which was very close to the present horse as it was also on Roundway Hill beneath the Oliver's Castle hill fort.  Traces of the Snobs Horse can still be seen under the right conditions. Uffington White Horse: The Uffington White Horse is a highly stylised prehistoric hill figure, 110 m long, formed from deep trenches filled with crushed white chalk.

Whilst the pub undoubtedly existed, several scholars have questioned the existence of the 'White Horse' meetings - they are described by John Foxe in his Book of Martyrs, but no other evidence for them exists.  Gergely M Juh\u00e1sz writes that 'Foxe\u2019s romantic image of these students and scholars convening secretly on a regular basis in the White Horse Inn\u2026 is unsubstantiated', and Alec Ryrie refers to it as 'the stubborn legend of the White Horse Inn.'

Civil war engulfed the Roman state in the mid 1st century BC, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and finally between Octavian and Mark Antony.  Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.  In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian \"imperator\" (\"commander\") thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD; they later awarded him the name Augustus, \"the venerated\".  The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs: the Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors\u2014Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero\u2014before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor.  Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, to be followed by the Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty which produced the \"Five Good Emperors\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius.  In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius, a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 AD marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\"\u2014a famous comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire."

He was also an outspoken critic of the investigation into his father's death, which he believed was a cover-up.  He maintained that the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) had murdered his father in order to prevent his parole\u2014which he believed to be imminent\u2014because the British government were afraid that his father, if allowed to speak freely, would reveal embarrassing information about British actions during World War II.  In 2007, however, documents demonstrating British support for Hess' release on humanitarian grounds and their campaign against steadfast Soviet opposition to his release were published. Nazi Party Chancellery: The Party Chancellery (\"Parteikanzlei\"), was the name of the head office for the German Nazi Party (NSDAP), designated as such on 12 May 1941.  The office existed previously as the Staff of the Deputy F\u00fchrer (\"Stab des Stellvertreters des F\u00fchrers\") but was renamed after Rudolf Hess flew to England in an attempt to negotiate a peace agreement without Hitler's authorization.  Hess was denounced by Hitler, his former office was dissolved, and the new Party Chancellery was formed in its place under Martin Bormann. Thule Society: The Thule Society ( ; German: \"Thule-Gesellschaft\" ), originally the \"Studiengruppe f\u00fcr germanisches Altertum\" (\"Study Group for Germanic Antiquity\"), was a German occultist and \"v\u00f6lkisch\" group founded in Munich right after World War I, named after a mythical northern country in Greek legend.  The Society is notable chiefly as the organization that sponsored the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP; German Workers' Party), which was later reorganized by Adolf Hitler into the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party).  According to Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw, the organization's \"membership list... reads like a Who's Who of early Nazi sympathizers and leading figures in Munich\", including Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Julius Lehmann, Gottfried Feder, Dietrich Eckart, and Karl Harrer. St Paul's tram stop: St Paul's tram stop is a tram stop serving nearby St Paul's Square, Birmingham, England.  It was opened on 31 May 1999 on the Midland Metro Line 1.

Warsaw (song): \"Warsaw\" is the opening song by Joy Division on their \"An Ideal for Living\" EP.  It was slated for release on the album that became \"Warsaw\", which was originally scrapped by the band and not released until 1994.  The song is available on a number of compilations, including \"Substance\".  The song appears to be a somewhat fantastical biography of Rudolf Hess, a Nazi and Hitler's Deputy F\u00fchrer, who flew to Great Britain in 1941 in an attempt to negotiate a peace between Germany and the UK, supposedly because of his disillusionment with Nazi ideology."

The McPeake family claim recognition for the writing of the song.  Francis McPeake is a member of a well known musical family in Belfast, Northern Ireland.  The lyrics and melody are a variant of the song \"The Braes of Balquhither\" by Scottish poet Robert Tannahill (1774\u20131810), a contemporary of Robert Burns.  Tannahill's original song, first published in Robert Archibald Smith's \"Scottish Minstrel\" (1821\u201324), is about the hills (\"braes\") around Balquhidder near Lochearnhead.

The Afghan Royal Family were the only humans who possessed this breed.  The bakhmull tazi (tazi means \" fast running sighthound\" ) is a long haired variety of sighthounds in Afghanistan.  There are two more: Luchak tazi short haired like sloughi and Khalagh tazi with moderate long hair on ears, shoulders, elbows and thighs.Bakhmull tazi has developed in the mountain areas of Mid and Central Asia - ancient Punjab, Paunchala, \"Five river land\".  This dog breed roots back presumably in the ancient Indian Harappa( Mohenjo Daro) civilization 2300 - 1700 B.C.  If translated from Pashto (Afghan) the word \"bakhmull\" means \"velvet\" due to its incredible silky velvet, long, ivory color hair of the coat, rather abundant and long on the whole body, because it is a mountain oriental sighthound, except the \"saddle\", front parts of four legs and the muzzle.  Its color is always fawn, ivory or white with a darker \"saddle\", thus it produces an impression of a fawn (yellowish) dog which coat color is protective khaki that matches sandstone and limestone of the Hindu Kush mountain landscape and deserts.  Following colors are not permissible: red, red with white spots, black and black with white spots.  Bakhmulls hunt the wild ram, ibex (wild mountain goat), hare, fox, wolf, jackal, wild big cats, in old times leopard, but never birds.  They are also good guards; they guard homes and flocks of sheep.  They hunt solo, in couples and rarely in packs.  Since the 1980s the centre of Bakhmull breeding is in Russia, \"The Blue Dale el Bark Bakhmull\" Moscow, where they are spread all over the former Soviet Republics and various regions.  The foundation stock was brought to Russia in the 70s by military men from Afghanistan.

The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, \"Fearless\" (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom.  It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings.  He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by.  Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him.  Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar.  Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of \"Rolling Stone\") citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of \"PopMatters\") indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements."

    "question": "What profession does Leonty Magnitsky and Leonid Khachiyan have in common? Context: Mursm\u00e4cka: Mursm\u00e4cka, also called \"bruksm\u00e4cka\" or only \"sm\u00e4cka\", was an historical profession for women in Sweden.  A mursm\u00e4cka was a female construction worker with the task to hand mortar during construction work.  The profession is recorded from at least 1691 (though it is not confirmed by name until the 1830s) and discontinued in 1922.  This was a very hard but common work for a poor uneducated women during the 19th century, particularly in Stockholm.  In July 1888, the Mursm\u00e4cka of Stockholm performed a great strike action which attracted considerable attention in contemporary Sweden. Legal Profession Admission Board: The Legal Profession Admission Board is the statutory authority responsible for the admission of lawyers in New South Wales.  It was formerly two separate boards; the Barristers Admission Board and the Solicitors Admission Board.  The \"Legal Profession Act 1993\" introduced common admission for both branches of the profession resulting in the merger of the two boards. Bullying in medicine: Bullying in the medical profession is common, particularly of student or trainee physicians.  It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession which may result in a bullying cycle. Leontius (Turkevich): Metropolitan Leontius (Leonty, secular name Leonid Ieronimovich Turkevich, Russian: \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434 \u0418\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 ; August 8, 1876 in Kremenetz, Volhynia \u2013 May 14, 1965) was the Metropolitan of the North American Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church from 1950 until his death in 1965.  He was succeeded by Metropolitan Irenaeus (Bekish). Nurse stereotypes: A stereotype is a generalized idea or image about a particular person or thing that is often oversimplified and offensive.  Stereotypes are victim of prejudice when negative portrayals of a group are untrue of individual members.  Nursing has been stereotyped throughout the history of the profession.  A common misconception is that all nurses are female; this has led to the stereotype of male nurses as effeminate.  These generalized ideas of the nursing profession have formed a skewed image of nurses in the media.  The image of a nurse projected by the media is typically of a young white single female being over-sexualized as well as diminished intellectually; this idea is then portrayed in get-well cards, television shows and novels.  The over-sexualized nurse is commonly referred to as a naughty nurse and is shown as a sex symbol or nymphomaniac. Along with these common stereotypes, studies have identified several other popular images used in media such as handmaiden, angel, torturer, homosexual male, alcoholic, buffoon and woman in white.  Common stereotypes of nursing and portrayal of these misconceptions have fueled a discussion on the effects they have on the profession, harmful or good. Leonid Khachiyan: Leonid Genrikhovich Khachiyan (Armenian: \u053c\u0565\u0578\u0576\u056b\u0564 \u0533\u0565\u0576\u0580\u056b\u056d\u0578\u057e\u056b\u0579 \u053d\u0561\u0579\u056b\u0575\u0561\u0576 ; Russian: \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434 \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0425\u0430\u0447\u0438\u044f\u043d ; May 3, 1952 \u2013 April 29, 2005) was a Soviet mathematician of Armenian descent who taught Computer Science at Rutgers University.  He was most famous for his ellipsoid algorithm (1979) for linear programming, which was the first such algorithm known to have a polynomial running time.  Even though this algorithm was shown to be impractical due to the high degree of the polynomial in its running time, it has inspired other randomized algorithms for convex programming and is considered a significant theoretical breakthrough. Convention (meeting): A convention, in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some common interest.  The most common conventions are based upon industry, profession, and fandom.  Trade conventions typically focus on a particular industry or industry segment, and feature keynote speakers, vendor displays, and other information and activities of interest to the event organizers and attendees.  Professional conventions focus on issues of concern to the profession and advancements in the profession.  Such conventions are generally organized by societies or communities dedicated to promotion of the topic of interest.  Fan conventions usually feature displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities.  Science fiction conventions traditionally partake of the nature of both professional conventions and fan conventions, with the balance varying from one to another.  Conventions also exist for various hobbies, such as gaming or model railroads.

Reading law: Reading law is the method by which persons in common law countries, particularly the United States, entered the legal profession before the advent of law schools.  This usage specifically refers to a means of entering the profession (although in England it is still customary to say that a university undergraduate is \"reading\" a course, which may be law or any other).  \"Reading the law\" consists of an extended internship or apprenticeship under the tutelage or mentoring of an experienced lawyer.  A small number of U.S. jurisdictions still permit this practice today."

    "question": "Irish print journalist, Arthur Quinlan, was the only one to interviewed which major figure of the Cuban Revolution? Context: Cuban League: The Cuban League was one of the earliest and longest lasting professional baseball leagues outside of the United States, operating in Cuba from 1878 to 1961.  The schedule usually operated during the winter months, so the league was sometimes known as the \"Cuban Winter League.\"  It was always a small league, generally 3 to 5 teams, and was centered in Havana, though it sometimes included teams from outlying cities such as Matanzas or Santa Clara.  The league became racially integrated in 1900, and during the first half of the 20th century the Cuban League was a premier venue for black and white players to meet.  Many great black Northern American players competed in Cuba alongside native black and white Cuban stars such as Jos\u00e9 M\u00e9ndez, Crist\u00f3bal Torriente, Adolfo Luque, and Mart\u00edn Dihigo.  After 1947, the Cuban League entered into an agreement with Major League Baseball and was used for player development.  Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, however, tensions rose with the new Communist government, and in March 1961 the government decreed the abolition of professional baseball. National Art Schools (Cuba): Cuba's National Art Schools (Escuelas Nacionales de Arte, now known as the Instituto Superior de Arte) are considered by historians to be among the most outstanding architectural achievements of the Cuban Revolution.  These innovative, organic Catalan-vaulted brick and terra-cotta structures were built on the site of a former country club in the far western Havana suburb of Cubanac\u00e1n, which used to be Havana's \"Beverly Hills\" and was then mainly reserved for Communist Party officials.  The schools were conceived and founded by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in 1961, and they reflect the utopian optimism and revolutionary exuberance of the early years of the Cuban Revolution.  Over their years of active use, the schools served as the primary incubator for Cuba\u2019s artists, musicians, actors and dancers. Eulogio Cantillo: Eulogio Cantillo (September 13, 1911, Cuba - September 9, 1978, Miami, Florida, U.S.) was a general in the pre-revolutionary Cuban army.  General Cantillo served as Chief of the Joint Staff during the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.  Cantillo did not participate in the military coup that brought Batista to power.  During the Cuban Revolution, he led Cuban soldiers in the fight against Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement.  After the Cuban Revolution, He was tried by the revolutionary tribunals and sentenced to 15 years in prison.  He was released before serving his entire sentence sometime in the sixties, and went into exile in Miami where he died in 1978. Rock Around the Blockade: Rock Around the Blockade (RATB), is a Cuba solidarity organisation in Britain founded by members of the Revolutionary Communist Group (UK) in 1995.  RATB sees the struggle to defend the Cuban Revolution as part of building a movement for socialism and communism in Britain.  In this is appears to differ from the Cuba Solidarity Campaign which attempts to build a broad front, largely but not exclusively through the mainstream labour movement, in support of the Cuban Revolution through emphasising the defence of Cuba's right to sovereignty. Brian Cuban: Brian Cuban is an American attorney, author, and activist.  He is often interviewed authority on Male Eating Disorders and a lawyer and activist in the areas of First Amendment issues and hate speech.  He is also the brother of Mark Cuban and resides in Dallas, Texas.  He was born on January 11, 1961, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  He grew up in Pittsburgh and attended Mt. Lebanon High School.  Cuban earned his undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University and his law degree from The University of Pittsburgh School of Law.  He is licensed to practice law in Pennsylvania (inactive) and Texas, specializing in First Amendment issues.  He runs a blog called \"The Cuban Revolution\" that he uses as a platform to discuss many First Amendment legal battles and news stories. Cuban immigration to the United States: Cuban immigration to the United States, for the most part, occurred in two periods: the first series of immigration of Cuban Americans from Cuba to the United States resulted from establishment of Cuban cigar factories in Tampa and from attempts to overthrow Spanish colonial rule by the movement led by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, the second from dissatisfaction with communist rule by Fidel Castro following the Cuban Revolution.  Massive Cuban migration to Miami during the second series led to major demographic and cultural changes in Miami.  There was also economic emigration, particularly during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Che Guevara: Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara (] June 14, 1928 \u2013 October 9, 1967) was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat and military theorist.  A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture. Arthur Quinlan: Arthur Quinlan (15 January 1921 \u2013 22 December 2012) was an Irish raconteur and print journalist with \"The Irish Times\".  Known for his interviews with politicians, royalty and film stars in a career spanning more than 50 years, he was widely regarded as a very important figure in his field, and was both the first Irishman to get a jet across the Atlantic Ocean to New York in 1958 and the only western journalist to have interviewed Che Guevara.  Considered a \"master of executing international scoops\", his work was sent across the world. Republic of Cuba (1902\u201359): The Republic of Cuba (Spanish: Rep\u00fablica de Cuba) of 1902 to 1959, refers to the historical period in Cuba from 1902, when Cuba seceded from US rule in the aftermath of the Spanish\u2013American War that took Cuba from Spanish rule in 1898, until the Cuban Revolution of 1959.  Cuban independence from the United States was guaranteed in the Platt Amendment proposed to the United States Congress in 1901.  It was officially a representative democracy though at times it became controlled by a military junta.  The Cuban Revolution of 1959 massively changed Cuban society, creating a socialist state and ended US economic dominance in Cuba. Coffee production in Cuba: Coffee has been grown in Cuba since the mid-18th century.  Boosted by French farmers fleeing the revolution in Haiti, coffee farms expanded from the western plains to the nearby mountain ranges.  Coffee production in eastern Cuba significantly increased during the 19th and early 20th centuries.  At its peak production, Cuba exported more than 20000 MT of coffee beans per year in the mid 1950s.  After the Cuban Revolution and the nationalization of the coffee industry, coffee production slowly began to decline until it reached all time lows during the Great Recession.  Once a major Cuban export, it now makes up an insignificant portion of Cuban trade.  By the 21st century, 92 percent of the country's coffee was grown in area of the Sierra Maestra mountains.  All Cuban coffee is exported by Cubaexport, which pays regulated prices to coffee growers and processors."

    "question": "Who lived longer Ellen Glasgow or N. Scott Momaday ? Context: House Made of Dawn: House Made of Dawn is a 1968 novel by N. Scott Momaday, widely credited as leading the way for the breakthrough of Native American literature into the mainstream.  It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1969, and has also been noted for its significance in Native American Anthropology. The Shadowy Third and Other Stories: The Shadowy Third and Other Stories is a 1923 short story collection by Ellen Glasgow.  Glasgow published only this one short story collection during her lifetime, which included seven stories.  While Glasgow's novels receive more critical attention, scholarship on her stories continues into the twenty-first century. Ellen Glasgow House: The Ellen Glasgow House, also known as the Branch-Glascow House, is a historic house at 1 West Main Street in Richmond, Virginia.  Built in 1841, it is nationally significant as the home of writer Ellen Glasgow (1873-1945) from 1887 until her death.  It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. Ari Berk: Ari Berk is an American writer, folklorist, artist, and scholar of literature, iconography, and comparative myth.  Berk holds degrees in Ancient History (B.A.), American Indian Studies (M.A.), and Comparative Literature and Culture (Ph.D.) from Humboldt State University and University of Arizona respectively.  His dissertation was directed by Pulitzer Prize winner N. Scott Momaday and Berk was appointed to the committee that developed the first American Indian Studies doctoral program in the United States. Native American Renaissance: The Native American Renaissance is a term originally coined by critic Kenneth Lincoln in the 1983 book \"Native American Renaissance\" to categorise the significant increase in production of literary works by Native Americans in the United States in the late 1960s and onwards.  A. Robert Lee and Alan Velie note that the book's title \"quickly gained currency as a term to describe the efflorescence on literary works that followed the publication of N. Scott Momaday's \"House Made of Dawn\" in 1968\".  Momaday's novel garnered critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1969. Virginia literature: The literature of Virginia, United States, includes fiction, poetry, and nonfiction.

Virginia (novel): Virginia (1913) is a novel by Ellen Glasgow about a wife and mother who in vain seeks happiness by serving her family.  This novel, her eleventh, marked a clear departure from Glasgow's previous work\u2014she had written a series of bestsellers before publishing \"Virginia\"\u2014in that it attacked, in a subtle yet unmistakable way, the very layer of society that constituted her readership.  Also, as its heroine, though virtuous and god-fearing, is denied the happiness she is craving, its plot did not live up to readers' expectations as far as poetic justice is concerned and was bound to upset some of them.  Today, \"Virginia\" is seen by many as an outstanding achievement in Glasgow's career, exactly because the author defied literary convention by questioning the foundations of American society around the dawn of the 20th century, be it capitalism, religion or racism. N. Scott Momaday: Navarre Scott Momaday (born February 27, 1934) \u2014 known as N. Scott Momaday \u2014 is a Kiowa novelist, short story writer, essayist, and poet.

    "question": "Does Linzhou, Henan have a larger population than Xingcheng? Context: C\u00e2mara de Lobos: C\u00e2mara de Lobos (] ; literally, Portuguese: \"chamber of the sealions\" ) is a municipality, parish and town in the south-central coast of the island of Madeira.  Technically a suburb of the much larger capital city of Funchal, it is one of the larger population centres and an extension of the Funchal economy. Huan River: The Huan River (), or Anyang River (\u5b89\u9633\u6cb3), is a river in Henan, China, and part of the Hai River basin.  The river rises north of Linzhou in northwestern Henan, and joins the Wei River near Neihuang in the northeast of the province. Linzhou, Henan: Linzhou (), formerly Lin County (\u6797\u53bf), is a county-level city in Anyang, Henan, China.  Adjacent to Shanxi Province and Hebei Province, it is located in the north of Henan Province and at the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains.  It covers an area of 2046 square kilometers and has a population of about one million. Shanxi\u2013Henan\u2013Shandong Railway: The Shanxi\u2013Henan\u2013Shandong Railway () or the Jinyulu Railway, also known as the Shanxi South Central Railway or the Watang\u2013Rizhao Railway, is an electrified double-track heavy freight railway across northern China.  The line runs 1260 km from the village of Watang in L\u00fcliang, Shanxi Province to the port of Rizhao in Shandong Province, and is named after the three provinces through which it passes Jin (Shanxi), Yu (Henan) and Lu (Shandong).  The line is the world's longest heavy freight railway and is designed to facilitate the export of coal from Shanxi to overseas markets.  The line can accommodate train speeds of up to 120 km/h .  Cities along route include L\u00fcliang, Liulin, Hongdong, Changzhi and Pingshun in Shanxi; Linzhou, Anyang, Tangyin, Puyang, Hebi, Fan County and Taiqian County in Henan; Liangshan County, Dongping, Ningyang, Xintai, Laiwu, Yiyuan, Yishui, Ju County, Junan and Rizhao in Shandong.  The line was built from 2010 to 2014 and operations began on December 30, 2014. Statistical inference: Statistical inference is the process of deducing properties of an underlying probability distribution by analysis of data.  Inferential statistical analysis infers properties about a population: this includes testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.  The population is assumed to be larger than the observed data set; in other words, the observed data is assumed to be sampled from a larger population. Shia Muslims in the Arab world: Islam is historically divided into two major sects, Sunni and Shia Islam, each with its own sub-sects.  Large numbers of Shia Arab Muslims live in some Arab countries including Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar.  Shia Muslims are a numerical majority in Iraq and Bahrain.  Approximately half of the population in Yemen are Shia Muslims.  Exactly half of Muslims in Lebanon are Shia Muslims.  There is also a very large population of Shia Muslims living in the Arab Persian Gulf countries especially in Saudi Arabia.  Approximately the whole population of East Saudi Arabia, the Eastern Province are Shia Muslims.  Although government statistics claim that roughly only 20-40% of the Muslim population are Shia Muslims, there has been dispute to the authenticity of this figure and recent reports and investigations indicate that there is in fact a much larger population of Shia Muslims present, with estimate figures over 45% or even making the majority of Muslim population.  Saudi Arabia follows a strict recently established sect of Islam, Wahhabism, there is little freedom of religion between the different sects even whilst all of the population are Muslims.  Smaller Shia groups are present in Egypt and Jordan.  Despite the heavy presence of Shia Muslims in some Arab countries, particularly among the population of the Persian Gulf Arab countries, they have been treated poorly throughout history.  Additionally, in recent times, Shia Muslims along with Kurds have faced genocide by the pan-Arabist regime of Saddam Hussein.  For both historical and political reasons, the Shia have fared rather poorly in much of the Arab world, and the topic of Shi\u2018ism and Shia groups is one of the most sensitive issues for the Sunni elite.  This article discusses both the history of Sh\u012b\u2018a Islam in the Arab world from the dawn of Islam and their current situation in the Arabic-speaking world. Riverview, New Brunswick: Riverview is a Canadian town in Albert County, New Brunswick, Canada.  Riverview is located on the south side of the Petitcodiac River, across from the larger cities of Moncton and Dieppe.  Riverview has an area of 34 km2 , and a population density of 564.6 PD/km2 .  Riverview's slogan is \"A Great Place To Grow\".  With a population of 19,667, Riverview is the fifth largest municipality in New Brunswick, having a larger population than the cities of Edmundston, Bathurst, Campbellton, and Miramichi, despite its designation of \"town\". Founder effect: In population genetics, the founder effect is the loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population.  It was first fully outlined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, using existing theoretical work by those such as Sewall Wright.  As a result of the loss of genetic variation, the new population may be distinctively different, both genotypically and phenotypically, from the parent population from which it is derived.  In extreme cases, the founder effect is thought to lead to the speciation and subsequent evolution of new species. Food Race: American environmental author Daniel Quinn coined the term Food Race (by analogy to the Cold War's \"nuclear arms race\") to describe an understanding of the current overpopulation emergency as a perpetually escalating crisis between growing human population and growing food production, fueled by the latter.  Quinn argues that as the worldwide human population increases, the typical international response is to more intensely produce and distribute food to feed these greater numbers of people.  However, assuming that population increases according to increased food availability, Quinn argues that this response only ends up leading to an even larger population and thus greater starvation in the end.  Therefore, Quinn's clear solution to the Food Race \u2014 to stop producing so much food \u2014 is not generally a common-sense or intuitive response; instead, it derives from seemingly counter-intuitive or \"outside-the-box\" thinking. Walpole (CDP), Massachusetts: Walpole is a small census-designated place (CDP) located within the much larger town (21 square miles in size) of Walpole in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States.  Walpole Town as it is called by the US Census Bureau, also includes a much larger population (24,070 in 2010).  The population of the Census Designated Place was 5,918 at the 2010 census."

    "question": "Max Hoffmann along with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, masterminded the devastating defeat of the Russian armies in a battle fought when ? Context: Battle of Byeokjegwan: The Battle of Byeokjegwan (or Py\u014fkje) (Chinese: \u78a7\u8e44\u9928\u5927\u6230; \"B\u00ec t\u00ed gu\u01cen d\u00e0zh\u00e0n\") was a battle fought on January 27, 1593 (January 26 according to the Japanese calendar of the time), between the armies of the Ming Dynasty led by Li Rusong, and the Japanese forces under Tachibana Muneshige, Ukita Hideie, and Kobayakawa Takakage.  As part of the Japanese Invasion of Korea (Imjin War), it was the first field battle fought during the war between the two sides. Max Hoffmann: Carl Adolf Maximilian Hoffmann (25 January 1869 \u2013 8 July 1927) was a German military strategist.  As a staff officer at the beginning of World War I, he was Chief of Staff of the 8th Army.  Hoffmann, along with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, masterminded the devastating defeat of the Russian armies at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes.  He then held the position of Chief of Staff of the Eastern Front.  At the end of 1917, he negotiated with Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.  In 1922, he tried to set up an anti-Soviet coalition without success. Operation Michael: Operation \"Michael\" was a major German military offensive during the First World War that began the Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918.  It was launched from the Hindenburg Line, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, France.  Its goal was to break through the Allied (Entente) lines and advance in a north-westerly direction to seize the Channel ports, which supplied the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and to drive the BEF into the sea.  Two days later General Ludendorff, the Chief of the German General Staff, changed his plan and pushed for an offensive due west, along the whole of the British front north of the River Somme.  This was designed to separate the French and British Armies and crush the British forces by pushing them into the sea.  The offensive ended at Villers-Bretonneux, to the east of the Allied communications centre at Amiens, where the Allies managed to halt the German advance; the German Armies had suffered many casualties and were unable to maintain supplies to the advancing troops. Battle of Tara (Ireland): The Battle of Tara was fought between the Gaelic Irish of Meath, led by M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill, and the Norse Vikings of Dublin, led by Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n.  It took place near the Hill of Tara in Ireland in the year 980.  The battle was a devastating defeat for the Vikings and led to the Irish regaining control of Dublin. First Battle of the Marne: The Battle of the Marne (French: Premi\u00e8re bataille de la Marne , also known as the Miracle of the Marne, \"Le Miracle de la Marne\") was a World War I battle fought from 6\u201310 September 1914.  It resulted in an Allied victory against the German armies in the west.  The battle was the culmination of the German advance into France and pursuit of the Allied armies which followed the Battle of the Frontiers in August and had reached the eastern outskirts of Paris.  A counter-attack by six French armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) along the Marne River forced the Imperial German Army to retreat north-west, leading to the First Battle of the Aisne and the Race to the Sea.  The battle was a victory for the Allies but led to four years of trench warfare stalemate on the Western Front. Battle of Arausio: The Battle of Arausio took place on 6 October 105 BC, at a site between the town of Arausio (modern day Orange, Vaucluse) and the Rh\u00f4ne River.  Ranged against the migratory tribes of the Cimbri under Boiorix and the Teutoni were two Roman armies, commanded by the proconsul Quintus Servilius Caepio and consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus.  However, bitter differences between the commanders prevented the Roman armies from cooperating, with devastating results.  The terrible defeat gave Gaius Marius the opportunity to come to the fore and radically reform the organization and recruitment of Roman legions.  Roman losses are described as being up to 80,000 troops, as well as another 40,000 auxiliary troops (allies) and servants and camp followers \u2014 virtually all of their participants in the battle.  In numbers of losses, this battle is regarded as the worst defeat in the history of ancient Rome. Battle of Anholt: The Battle of Anholt (25\u201327 March 1811) occurred during the Gunboat War, a war between the United Kingdom and Denmark-Norway.  It was an attempt by the Danes to recapture Anholt, a small Danish island off the coast of Jutland, which the British had captured in 1809.  The Danish army had a larger fighting force than the British, but a lack of planning and supply failures led to a devastating defeat and many Danish casualties.  After the battle, the British occupation of Anholt continued until the peace treaty in 1814.  There is a monument commemorating the battle in Anholt village. Battle of Svensksund: The Battle of Svensksund (Finnish: \"Ruotsinsalmi\", Russian: \"Rochensalm\") was a naval battle fought in the Gulf of Finland outside the present day city of Kotka on 9 and 10 July 1790.  The Swedish naval forces dealt the Russian fleet a devastating defeat that resulted in an end to the Russo-Swedish War of 1788\u201390.  The battle is the biggest Swedish naval victory and the largest naval battle ever in the Baltic Sea. Battle of Tannenberg: The Battle of Tannenberg was fought between Russia and Germany from 26\u201330 August 1914, during the first month of World War I.  The battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov.  A series of follow-up battles (First Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army as well and kept the Russians off balance until the spring of 1915.  The battle is particularly notable for fast rail movements by the Germans, enabling them to concentrate against each of the two Russian armies in turn, and also for the failure of the Russians to encode their radio messages.  It brought considerable prestige to Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and his rising staff-officer Erich Ludendorff. Polish\u2013Soviet War in 1919: In 1918, the German Army in the east was the most powerful force in the region.  Even more importantly, it was not only undefeated, it was victorious (in contrast to the German Army on the western front).  However the commander of the German forces in the east, Max Hoffmann, a chief negotiator in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was facing increasing difficulties.  He believed, rightly, that his army was the only stabilising influence over the Eastern Europe.  Yet with the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, rise of Bolsheviks in the east and various independent governments between the former frontline and Germany, the former \"Oberkommando-Ostfront\" (or \"Ober-Ost\") occupation zone became a thin line to nowhere, connected only to still-German Prussia.  The deteriorating situation in Germany, facing the threat of civil war, eventually forced Hoffman to begin to retreat westwards, to Germany, in December 1918.  Demoralized officers and mutinous soldiers abandoned their garrisons \"en masse\" and returned home.  Only a limited number of units still retained any combat strength."

However, the band's eponymous vocalist was unhappy with Mosimann's production, claiming it was too \"smoothed and polished\", and poorly representative of the band's established sound.

The song is inspired by what Manson had to grow up with and how it turned him into what he is now, a man or monster that people now have grown to fear.  The line, \"Sticking to my pointy ribs/ Are all your infants in abortion cribs\" refers to a story told in \"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell\" in which Manson as a child found a coffee can with something rotting inside.  His mother told him it was discarded meat, but later told him that it was actually an aborted fetus.  The song was initially penned during Manson's cousin Chad's wedding ceremony.

It is typically prepared as a disodium salt. Malachite green: Malachite green is an organic compound that is used as a dyestuff and controversially as an antimicrobial in aquaculture.  Malachite green is traditionally used as a dye for materials such as silk, leather, and paper.  Although called malachite green, this dye is not prepared from the mineral malachite\u2014the name just comes from the similarity of color. Phloxine: Phloxine B (commonly known simply as phloxine) is a water-soluble red dye used for coloring drugs and cosmetics in the United States and coloring food in Japan.  It is derived from fluorescein, but differs by the presence of four bromine atoms at positions 2, 4, 5 and 7 of the xanthene ring and four chlorine atoms in the carboxyphenyl ring.  It has an absorption maximum around 540 nm and an emission maximum around 564 nm.  Apart from industrial use, phloxine B has functions as an antimicrobial substance, viability dye and biological stain.  For example, it is used in hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron (HPS) staining to color the cytoplasm and connective tissue in shades of red. Quercus coccifera: Quercus coccifera, the kermes oak, is an oak in the \"Quercus\" section \"Cerris\".  It is native to the Mediterranean region and Northern African Maghreb, south to north from Morocco to France and west to east from Portugal to Cyprus and Turkey, crossing Spain, Italy, Libya, Balkans, and Greece, including Crete.  The Kermes Oak was historically important as the food plant of the Kermes scale insect, from which a red dye called crimson was obtained.  The etymology of the specific name 'coccifera' is related to the production of red cochineal (crimson) dye and derived from Latin \"coccum\" which was from Greek \u03ba\u1f40\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, the kermes insect.  The Latin \"-fera\" means 'bearer'. Dye Creek: Dye Creek is an 18.2 mi watercourse in Tehama County, California, United States, that is tributary to the Sacramento River.  Dye Creek's watershed is situated in north-central California.  The Dye Creek watershed contains rugged terrain areas of oak-studded forest, and also provides habitat for numerous understory flora and fauna.  An example forb found in the watershed is the poppy \"Calochortus luteus\", which is at its northern limit around the Dye Creek watershed. Hina (given name): Hina (Urdu: \u062d\u0646\u0627\u200e ) is a female name.  In South Asia and the Middle East, derived from Henna.  In Japan derived from light or sun.  In the Pacific Islands, derived from A goddess of various Polynesian cultures. Henna: Henna (Arabic: \u062d\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0621\u200e \u200e ) is a dye prepared from the plant \"Lawsonia inermis\", also known as hina, the henna tree, the mignonette tree, and the Egyptian privet, the sole species of the \"Lawsonia\" genus. Indigofera tinctoria: Indigofera tinctoria, also called true indigo, is a species of plant from the bean family that was one of the original sources of indigo dye.  It has been naturalized to tropical and temperate Asia, as well as parts of Africa, but its native habitat is unknown since it has been in cultivation worldwide for many centuries.  Today most dye is synthetic, but natural dye from \"I. tinctoria\" is still available, marketed as natural coloring where it is known as tarum in Indonesia and nila in Malaysia.  In Iran and areas of the former Soviet Union it is known as basma.  The plant is also widely grown as a soil-improving groundcover. Lawsonia inermis: Lawsonia inermis, also known as hina, the henna tree, the mignonette tree, and the Egyptian privet, is a flowering plant and the sole species of the Lawsonia genus.  It is the source of the dye henna used to dye skin, hair and fingernails, as well as fabrics including silk, wool and leather."

    "question": "Which body of water flows through more states, Tamiami Canal or Genesee River? Context: Black Creek (Genesee River): Black Creek is a tributary of the Genesee River that runs for 46 mi in western New York, United States.  The creek begins in Middlebury in Wyoming County and runs north for roughly the first half of its course and east for the other half, eventually joining the Genesee River in Chili, Monroe County.  Its drainage area spans around 202 mi2 , which is largely rural and agricultural.  As of 2000, 40,000 residents lived in the creek's drainage area. Riverton, New York: Riverton, New York was a planned community built in 1973 in the town of Henrietta, New York, along the Genesee River.  Riverton was seventh of the thirteen communities receiving Federal guarantee assistance from HUD as part of their New Communities Program created by the Urban Growth and New Community Development Act of 1970.  $12 million was earmarked for the community.  Riverton was supposed to encompass a 2335 acre land area bordered on the north by the New York State Thruway, on the west by the Genesee River, on the east by East River Rd., and on the south by the Rush-Henrietta town line, with some development continuing east along Erie Station Rd.  Original plans called for construction to occur for a 16-year period and eventually house over 25,000 people, with the community including an 18-hole golf course, 12 swimming pools, 3 artificial lakes, a marina on the Genesee, and commercial and industrial centers.  However, only a small portion of this was built along Scottsville-West Henrietta Rd.  Created as part of the community were Riverton Knolls, a moderately priced townhouse subdivision, the Riverton Golf Club, a small 9-hole golf course, and the Riverton Park, which included a playground, baseball diamond, river front benches, walking trail, and a volleyball court.  Also nestled in a bend in the Genesee was a 28 acre forested nature park. Spring creek: A spring creek is a type of free flowing river whose name derives from its origin: an underground spring or set of springs which produces sufficient water to consistently feed a unique river.  The water flowing in a spring creek may additionally be fed by snow pack or rain run-off, as in most traditional free-flowing rivers, but often the entire water source for a spring creek is an aquifer or other underground water source.  For this reason, spring creeks are often filled with very pure, clean water and also demonstrate water flows that are smooth, consistent, and unwavering throughout the seasons of the year - unlike rivers filled with run-off or spring and summer melt-off from snow pack, whose water flows, water clarity, and water conditions often vary highly over the course of the year.  In addition, water temperatures in spring creeks tend to vary less throughout the seasons of the year than traditional creeks and rivers because they are fed by underground water sources.  Because of the depths of these water sources, spring creeks often emerge from their source or headwaters very cold and stay that way over the length of their runs.  In addition, due to the consistent water flows and the fact that spring creek water is \"pushed\" by the force of pressure from the source rather than \"pulled\" by the force of gravity downhill, spring creeks can flow through very flat sections of land with minimal depths over grades that might not sustain run-off creeks and rivers.  In these low-grade or flat sections of spring creeks, water flows can appear almost laminar with the surface of the creek appearing to be nearly flat and without the prominent riffles and surface disturbances caused by more rough or uneven surface bottoms found below free-stone run-off creeks and rivers surfaces. Broad Street Bridge (Rochester, New York): Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct, also known as the Broad Street Aqueduct or Broad Street Bridge, is a historic stone aqueduct located at Rochester in Monroe County, New York.  It was constructed in 1836-1842 and originally carried the Erie Canal over the Genesee River.  The overall length of the aqueduct including the wings and abutments is 800 ft .  The aqueduct is 70 ft wide and has massive parapets on either side.  It is one of four major aqueducts in the mid-19th century Erie Canal system.  In 1927, a roadbed was added to carry automobile traffic and named Broad Street.  It also carried a part of the Rochester Subway. Crystal Lake (Gilmanton, New Hampshire): Crystal Lake is a 455 acre water body located in Belknap County in the Lakes Region of central New Hampshire, United States, in the town of Gilmanton.  Crystal Lake is at the head of the Suncook River watershed.  Water flows into Crystal Lake from the Belknap Range through Manning and Sunset lakes to the north.  Water from Manning Lake enters Crystal Lake via Nelson Brook.  Other waterways flowing into Crystal Lake include Wasson Brook and Mill Brook.  Water flows out of a dam from the southern end of Crystal Lake via the Suncook Lakes and Suncook River to the Merrimack River.  Shoreline development along Crystal Lake consists primarily of summer cottages, with a few year-round residents.  Belknap Mountain and Mount Major can be seen from the shoreline. Oatka Creek: Oatka Creek ( ) is the third longest tributary of the Genesee River, located entirely in the Western New York region of the U.S. state of New York.  From southern Wyoming County, it flows 58 mi to the Genesee near Scottsville, draining an area of 215 sqmi that includes all or part of 23 towns and villages in Wyoming, Genesee, Livingston and Monroe counties as well.  Its name means \"leaving the highlands\" or \"approaching an opening\" in Seneca. Treaty of Big Tree: Treaty of Big Tree was a formal treaty signed in 1797 between the Seneca Nation and the United States in which the Seneca relinquished their rights to nearly all of their traditional homeland in New York State\u2014 nearly 3.5 million acres.  In the 1788 Phelps and Gorham Purchase the Iroquois had previously sold rights to their land between Seneca Lake and the Genesee River.  The Treaty of Big Tree signed away their rights to all their territory west of the Genesee River except twelve small tracts of land for $100,000 and other consideration (roughly ). Tamiami Canal: The Tamiami Canal or C-4 Canal, is a canal located in southern Florida in the United States.  It flows in a west to east direction from the western part of the state in the Everglades past the Miami International Airport to a salinity control center near the Miami River.  It averages 8 ft in depth and is over 100 ft wide in some areas. Flagami: The Flagami is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States, roughly defined as south and east of the Tamiami Canal, north of the Tamiami Trail (US 41/South Eighth Street), and west of Red Road (SR 959/West 57th Avenue), bisected by Flagler Street. Genesee Valley Park: Genesee Valley Park is located in the south side of Rochester, New York along the shores of the Genesee River.  The New York State Barge Canal (the currently in-use portion of the Erie Canal) crosses the Genesee River within the park.  The University of Rochester is located near the park's north entrance."

Japan\u2013United States relations: Japan\u2013United States relations (\u65e5\u7c73\u95a2\u4fc2 ) began in the late 18th and early 19th century, with the diplomatic but force-backed missions of U.S. ship captains James Glynn and Matthew C. Perry to the Tokugawa shogunate being of particular importance.  The countries maintained relatively cordial relations after that, and Japanese immigration to the United States was prominent until the 20th century, up until the 1930s, when Japanese actions during the Second Sino-Japanese War caused the United States to impose harsh sanctions against Japan, ultimately leading to the Japanese surprise attack against the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, opening the Pacific War theater of World War II.  The United States and its Allies ultimately defeated Japan, and war ended with the American atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Japan surrendered, and was subjected to seven years of military occupation by the United States, during which the American occupiers helped rebuild the country, shared American technology, and carried out widespread political and economic reforms so as to transform Japan into a democracy and a potential bulwark against Communism.  Following the end of the occupation, the countries' relationship prospered again.  A new military alliance treaty, an exchange of technology and culture produced a strong alliance.  The countries' trade relationship has particularly prospered since then, with Japanese automobiles and consumer electronics being especially popular. Battle of Savanur: The Battle of Savanur occurred between the forces of the Maratha Empire and the forces of the Kingdom of Mysore from September 1786 to October 1786.  Maratha general, Haripant's army decided to move to Savanur due to growing illness and lack of resources amongst his Maratha troops.  His army was pursued by the forces of Tipu Sultan, who made two attacks early in September on the Maratha camp, which proved to be indecisive.  On 15 September 1786, Tipu's army encamped approximately 5 miles from Savanur.  On 1 October 1786, Tipu's army divided into four columns and made a surprise attack on the Maratha position.  The Marathas, however, were informed by their spies about Tipu's surprise attack and had evacuated their position.  The Marathas moved to a height from which they attacked Tipu's forces with artillery.  Tipu ordered his troops not to fire back to deceive the Marathas into thinking that he did not possess long range guns.  He did this to lure the Marathas to make an offensive.  The strategy had proven to be effective, and the Marathas advanced to the Mysore position.  When the Marathas had come close enough, Tipu's army unleashed a strong barrage of heavy fire on them.  Tipu's heavy firing on the Marathas continued for approximately 7 hours.  The Marathas were forced to retreat and Tipu Sultan entered Savanur on 10 October 1786 with support from the inhabitants of the city. Thomas James Reeves: Thomas James Reeves, born in Thomaston, Connecticut, December 9, 1895, was a US Navy radioman who became the namesake of the destroyer escort USS\u00a0\"Reeves\" .

    "question": "What is the primary duty of the Austrian Pinscher and the Maremma Sheepdog? Context: Connecticut State Marshal: Connecticut State Marshals are sworn peace officers in the State of Connecticut.  Their primary duty is to serve and execute civil process directed to them from courts or various state agencies.  There are approximately 235 state marshals serving in Connecticut, assigned to specific counties within the state.  Connecticut state marshal operations are overseen by the State Marshal Commission, an executive branch commission within the Department of Administrative Services, located in Hartford, Connecticut. Registrar of Companies, India: The Registrar of Companies (ROC) is an office under the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs that deals with administration of the Companies Act 1956 and Companies Act, 2013.  There are currently 22 Registrars of Companies (ROC) operating from offices in all major states of India.  Some states, such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, have two ROCs each.  Section 609 of the Companies Act, 1956 tasks the ROCs with the primary duty of registering companies and LLPs floated in the respective states and the union territories under their administration. Maremma Sheepdog: The Maremma Sheepdog, in Italian Cane da pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese, is a breed of livestock guardian dog indigenous to central Italy, particularly to Abruzzo and the Maremma region of Tuscany and Lazio.  It has been used for centuries by Italian shepherds to guard sheep from wolves.  The literal English translation of the name is \"The dog of the shepherds of the Maremma and Abruzzese region\".  The English name of the breed derives from that of the Maremma marshlands, where until recently shepherds, dogs and hundreds of thousands of sheep over-wintered, and where the breed is today abundant although sheep-farming has decreased substantially.  The breed is widely employed in Abruzzo, where sheep herding remains vital to the rural economy and the wolf remains an active and protected predator.  Similar breeds include the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, the Kuvasz of Hungary, the Tatra of Poland, the Cuvac of Slovakia and the \u0160arplaninac (although not white), with all of which it may share a common ancestor; and the Akbash Dog of Turkey. Arthur (dog): Arthur is an Ecuadorian street dog who attached himself to a Swedish extreme sports team when they were competing in the Adventure Racing World Championship in 2014, and now lives in \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, Sweden and has inspired a foundation to help other Ecuadorian street dogs.  According to his owner Mikael Lindnord, Arthur is presumed to be a Maremma Sheepdog mix. Seungjeongwon: Seungjeongwon was the Royal Secretariat during the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (1392 - 1910) in charge of receiving and delivering the king's order.  The office was also called \"Jeongwon\", \"Huwon\", \"Eundae\", or \"Daeeonsa\".  According to the \"Gyeongguk daejeon\" (Complete Codes of Law), the Seungjeongwon had 6 Royal Secretaries (\"Seungji\" \u627f\u65e8), whose ranks were in the 3rd senior grade, as well as two recorders (\"juseo\" \u6ce8\u66f8).  The duties of the royal secretaries were primarily to deliver the monarch\u2019s orders to government organizations (under the Joseon administrative system the monarch never delivered his orders directly to any government office) and to report on official affairs of the state organizations to the throne.  The six secretary system is explained by the fact that the government of Joseon was composed of six Boards (or Ministries).  The six secretaries served respectively the Boards of Personnel, War, Taxation, Rites, Works, and Punishment.  However, the secretaries were not limited to liaison work between the Six Boards and the monarch; they also reported to the king the business of all government offices, primary among these being the State Council (\"Uijeong-bu\"), the Office of Censor-General (\"Saganwon\"), and the Office of Inspector-General (\"Saheon-bu\").  As the name implies, the primary duty of the recorders was to make a record of all the official business handled by the secretaries.  As the work of the secretaries had to be conducted at all hours, and it was required that they have ready access to the monarch at all times, the office the Seungjeongwon was established within easy reach of the king at court. Queen's Remembrancer: The Queen's Remembrancer (or King's Remembrancer) is an ancient judicial post in the legal system of England and Wales.  Since the Lord Chancellor no longer sits as a judge, the Remembrancer is the oldest judicial position in continual existence.  The post was created in 1154 by King Henry II as the chief official in the Exchequer Court, whose purpose was 'to put the Lord Treasurer and the Barons of Court in remembrance of such things as were to be called upon and dealt with for the benefit of the Crown', a primary duty being to keep records of the taxes, paid and unpaid.  The first King's Remembrancer was Richard of Ilchester, a senior servant of the Crown and later Bishop of Winchester.  The King's Remembrancer continued to sit in the Court of the Exchequer until its abolition in 1882.  The post of Queen's Remembrancer is held by the Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court. Nawab: Nawab (Eastern Nagari: \u09a8\u09ac\u09be\u09ac/\u09a8\u0993\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09ac, Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u093e\u092c, Perso-Arab: \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628) also spelt Nawaab, Navaab, Navab, Nowab and Nobab is an honorific title ratified and bestowed by the reigning Mughal emperor to semi-autonomous Muslim rulers of princely states in South Asia.  \"Nawab\" usually refers to males; the female equivalent is \"begum\" or \"nawab begum\".  The primary duty of a nawab was to uphold the sovereignty of the Mughal emperor along with the administration of a certain province. Herb Strewer: The post of Herb Strewer is an obsolete position in the United Kingdom dating back to the late 17th century.

Michigan Conservation Officers: Michigan Conservation Officers are conservation officers who are the enforcement branch of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.  Their primary duty is to enforce the environmental laws in the State of Michigan.  Michigan Conservation Officers are fully commissioned peace officers and are empowered to enforce all the laws of the state of Michigan, with the exception of some traffic law.  The definition of peace officer under traffic law does not include 'Conservation Officer' and as such, Conservation Officer's are only able to execute traffic stops for violations of general state law or acts ancillary to hunting/conservation law. Austrian Pinscher: The Austrian Pinscher (\u00d6sterreichischer Pinscher, FCI No. 64) is a medium-sized breed of pinscher-type dog from Austria, where dogs of the type were originally farm dogs, keeping barns free of rats and acting as home guards, livestock guardians, and drovers.  The name originally given to the breed in 1928 was the \"\u00d6sterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher\" (\"Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher\") to differentiate it from similarly named breeds, but today in its country of origin the breed is officially called the \u00d6sterreichischer Pinscher, or Austrian Pinscher in English."

    "question": "The castle where \"Spook Squad\" was filmed is in what part of Scotland? Context: Edinburgh Castle: Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, from its position on the Castle Rock.  Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear.  There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued to be a royal residence until 1633.  From the 15th century the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison.  Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half.  As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite Rising of 1745.  Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year-old history, giving it a claim to having been \"the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world\". Ardencaple Castle: Ardencaple Castle, also known as Ardincaple Castle, and sometimes referred to as Ardencaple Castle Light, is a listed building, situated about 1 smi from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.  Today, all that remains of the castle is a tower, perched on the edge of a plateau, looking down on a flat tract of land between it and the shore of the Firth of Clyde.  The original castle was thought to have been built sometime in the 12th century, and part of the remains of the original castle were said to have existed in the 19th century.  Today, that sole remaining tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde.  Because of its use as a lighthouse the tower has been called Ardencaple Castle Light.

It was built as a private residence for Sir George Bullough, a textile tycoon from Lancashire whose father bought R\u00f9m as his summer residence and shooting estate.  Construction began in 1897, and was completed in 1900.  Built as a luxurious retreat, Kinloch Castle has since declined.  The castle and island are now owned by Scottish Natural Heritage, and part of the castle operates as a hostel.  The Kinloch Castle Friends Association was established in 1996 to secure the long-term future of the building. Crail Castle: Crail Castle was a castle that was located in Crail, Fife, Scotland.

The castle was sited above the harbour.  No remains above ground are visible. Tilquhillie Castle: Tilquhillie Castle is a castle near Banchory in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  A Category A listed building, the castle formally formed part of the lands of Arbroath Abbey.  Historic Environment Scotland's listed-building report from 1972 described the castle thus: Castle Semple: Castle Semple (previously Castletoun) is a former mansion house located in Renfrewshire, Scotland.  It is situated near the eastern end of Castle Semple Loch, within Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park.  Erected, or more probably rebuilt, by John Sempill, 1st Lord Sempill, he changed its name from Castletoun to Castle-Semple.  In Willem Blaeu's \"Atlas Maior\", published in 1654, the castle is represented by a mark denoting the largest size of castles.  In George Crawford's \"History of Renfrewshire\" (1710), he noted, \"\"Upon the brink of the loch stands the castle of Sempill, the principal messuage of a fair lordship of the same denomination, which consists of a large court, part of which seems to be a very ancient building, adorned with pleasant orchards and gardens.\"\"  According to Gardner, Castleton was built in 1492-3, but Millar states that it was built closer to 1550, as a successor to Elliston Castle. Loch Leven Castle: Loch Leven Castle is a ruined castle on an island in Loch Leven, in the Perth and Kinross local authority area of Scotland.  Possibly built around 1300, the castle was the location of military action during the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296\u20131357).  In the latter part of the 14th century, the castle was granted by his uncle to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, and remained in Douglas' hands for the next 300 years.  Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned here in 1567\u20131568, and forced to abdicate as queen, before escaping with the help of her gaoler's family.  In 1588, the Queen's gaoler inherited the title Earl of Morton, and moved away from the castle.  It was bought, in 1675, by Sir William Bruce, who used the castle as a focal point in his garden; it was never again used as a residence. Hatton Castle, Angus: Hatton Castle stands on the lower part of Hatton Hill, the most easterly of the Sidlaw Hills, to the south of Newtyle in Angus, Scotland.  The castle overlooks the wooded Den of Newtyle, and its views extend across Strathmore and include Ben Lawers and Schiehallion as well as the Angus and Glenshee hills.  The 16th-century castle was originally built in a typical Scottish \"Z plan\" tower house design, as a fortified country house or \"ch\u00e2teau\".  There was an earlier castle called Balcraig Castle which stood less than half a mile from the present building, also on Hatton Hill. Spook Squad: Spook Squad is a British children's television gameshow created by BBC Scotland.  It ran on CBBC's section BBC1 and BBC2 from 6 January 2004, to 30 March 2004.  The gameshow featured three children contestants entering a haunted castle in Scotland to assist Professor MacAbre in hunting ghosts before they reach their \"death day\" and gain superpowers.  The show was filmed in Fyvie Castle. Balloch Castle: Balloch Castle is an early 19th-century country house situated at the southern tip of Loch Lomond, in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland.  Balloch was a property of the Lennox family from the 11th century, and the old castle was built in the 13th century.  In the 19th century the estate was purchased by John Buchanan of Ardoch, who demolished the ruins of the old castle and erected the present building.  The Tudor Gothic architecture is the work of Robert Lugar.  In 1915 Balloch was bought by Glasgow City Corporation, and has been leased by West Dunbartonshire Council since 1975.  The estate was designated as a country park in 1980, and since 2002 has been part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.  Although the house has been periodically used for visitor facilities and council offices, it is now included on the Buildings at Risk Register.  Balloch Castle is a category A listed building, and the estate is included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland."

    "question": "Socialist conferences were held with what countries that opposed the Central Powers in the First World War? Context: List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War I: World War I (also known as the First World War and the Great War) was a global military conflict that embroiled most of the world's great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Entente and the Central Powers.  The immediate cause of the war was the June 28, 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb citizen of Austria\u2013Hungary and member of the Black Hand.  The retaliation by Austria\u2013Hungary against Serbia activated a series of alliances that set off a chain reaction of war declarations.  Within a month, much of Europe was in a state of open warfare, resulting in the mobilization of more than 65\u00a0million European soldiers, and more than 40\u00a0million casualties\u2014including approximately 20\u00a0million deaths by the end of the war. Vienna Socialist Conference of 1915: The Vienna Socialist Conference of 1915 gathered representatives from the Socialist parties of Germany, Austria and Hungary to the only meeting of the pro-war socialist parties of the Central Powers during World War I. Zimmerwald Conference: The Zimmerwald Conference was held in Zimmerwald, Switzerland, from 5 to 8 September 1915.  It was the first of three international socialist conferences convened by anti-militarist socialist parties from countries that were originally neutral during World War I.  The individuals and organizations participating in this and subsequent conferences held at Kienthal and Stockholm are known jointly as the Zimmerwald movement. Naval warfare of World War I: Naval Warfare in World War I was mainly characterized by the efforts of the Allied Powers, with their larger fleets and surrounding position, to blockade the Central Powers by sea, and the efforts of the Central Powers to break that blockade or to establish an effective blockade of the United Kingdom and France with submarines and raiders. Allies of World War I: The Allies of World War I, or Entente Powers, were the countries that opposed the Central Powers in the First World War. Siege of Medina: Medina, an Islamic holy city in Arabia, underwent a long siege during World War I.  Medina was at the time part of the Ottoman Empire.  In the war, the Ottoman Empire sided with the Central Powers.  Sharif Hussain of Mecca revolted against the caliph and the Ottoman Empire which, under the leadership of the nationalistic Young Turks, had ignored the wishes of the Caliph and sided with the Central Powers.  Hussain instead sided with the British Empire.  T. E. Lawrence was instrumental in this revolt.  Hussain occupied Mecca and besieged Medina.  It was one of the longest sieges in history that lasted till even after the end of war.  Fahreddin Pasha was the defender of Medina.  Some celebrated him as \"\"the Lion of the Desert\"\" despite the suffering of those who remained in Medina.  The siege lasted two years and seven months. Diplomatic history of World War I: The Diplomatic history of World War I covers the non-military interactions among the major players during World War I.  For the domestic histories see Home front during World War I.  For a longer-term perspective see International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919) and Causes of World War I.  For the following era see International relations (1919\u20131939).  The major players included Great Britain, France, Russia, and Italy (1915) ]] and the United States (1917).  The major Central Powers included Germany and the Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire (Turkey).  Other countries\u2014and their colonies\u2014were also involved.  For a detailed chronology see Timeline of World War I. Leaders of the Central Powers of World War I: The leaders of the Central Powers of World War I were the political or military figures who commanded or supported the Central Powers during World War I. World War I reparations: World War I reparations were compensation imposed during the Paris Peace Conference upon the Central Powers following their defeat in the First World War by the Allied and Associate Powers.  Each of the defeated powers was required to make payments in either cash or kind.  Because of the financial situation Austria, Hungary, and Turkey found themselves in after the war, few to no reparations were paid and the requirements for reparations were cancelled.  Bulgaria, having paid only a fraction of what was required, saw its reparation figure reduced and then cancelled.  Historians have recognised the German requirement to pay reparations as the \"chief battleground of the post-war era\" and \"the focus of the power struggle between France and Germany over whether the Versailles Treaty was to be enforced or revised\". Ukrainian War of Independence: The Ukrainian War of Independence was a period of sustained warlike conflict between different political and military forces, lasting from 1917 to 1921, which resulted in the establishment and development of a Ukrainian republic, later a part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  It consisted of a series of military conflicts between different governmental, political and military forces, among them Ukrainian nationalists, anarchists, Bolsheviks, the Central Powers forces of Germany and Austria-Hungary, the White Russian Volunteer Army, and Second Polish Republic forces for control of Ukraine after the February Revolution in the Russian Empire.  Also involved were the Allied forces of Romania and France.  The struggle lasted from February 1917 to November 1921 and resulted in the division of Ukraine between the Bolshevik Ukrainian SSR, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.  The conflict is frequently viewed within the framework of the Russian Civil War as well as the closing stage of the Eastern Front of the First World War."

However, if a Deputy Prime Minister has not been appointed, the Minister in the cabinet who has served the longest time (and if there are several with equal experience the one who is oldest) takes over as head of government.  Note that the person acting as Prime Minister does not do so on a permanent basis: if a Prime Minister dies, resigns or loses a vote of confidence in the Riksdag, the Speaker of the Riksdag will then confer with the parties of the Riksdag and propose a new Prime Minister, who must be tolerated by a majority of the Riksdag.  If the Prime Minister has resigned or lost a vote of confidence, he or she will remain the head of a government \"ad interim\" until the new Prime Minister assumes his or her office.  The only case where the governmental line of succession becomes relevant is when the Prime Minister dies (upon which the person next in the line of succession serves as the head of a government \"ad interim\") or when the Prime Minister is on leave or for any other reason incapable of serving, but still remains in office.  This might be compared to the Presidential line of succession in the United States, where the person next in line assumes the Presidency throughout the remainder of the term if the President dies, resigns or is impeached.

It was first aired by Canal de las Estrellas in 1970 in Mexico, and then was aired across Latin America and Spain until 1981, alongside \"El Chavo\", which shared the same cast of actors.  Both shows have endured in re-runs and have won back some of their popularity in several countries such as Colombia, where it has aired in competition with \"The Simpsons\" (which has a character based on him), or Peru.  The name translates literally in English as \"The Red Grasshopper\" (the word \"chapul\u00edn\" is of Nahuatl origin and applies to a Mexican species of grasshopper, while \"colorado\" refers to having conspicuous red colouration.  The word can also mean ruddy, reddish, red-coloured or crimson, blushing for instances would be said to cause the cheeks to be \"colorados\", and the skin would be \"colorada\" when you get a sunburn).

By describing the lives of these two people who live in the Dutch controlled islands of Java, Pramoedya is able to discuss many aspects of life in a colonized nation.  \"Child of All Nations\" explores the social hierarchy in a colonized nation by giving glimpses of how the oppressed colonized peoples, such as the Javanese farmers, are required to be submissive to their occupiers, the Dutch.  That wealthy, educated Javanese like Minke and Nyai were still considered inferior to the Dutch due to their Native birth status and frequently simply the color of their skin.  The main theme of the novel is, as the title suggests, that the world is becoming more integrated as revealed in the life of the main character Minke, the self-proclaimed \u201cchild of all nations\u201d .  Minke speaks French, Dutch, Malay, and both high and low Javanese.  He writes for a newspaper published in Dutch and has to come to terms with being a 'native' in a European controlled world.  His worldview is jaded by the fact that he is wealthy and educated, and therefore closer to the Dutch than other Javanese; however, Minke comes to realize the ethical implications of the injustices being done to his people.

    "question": "What type of film are both \"500 Years Later\" and \"Manson\"? Context: Kyokusui-no-en: Kyokusui-no-en (\u66f2\u6c34\u306e\u5bb4 (\"Winding stream party\" ) ) is a modern Japanese ceremony replicating a historical party game played by the nobility.  Participants must compose a tanka poem beside a stream, within a time limit set by the passage of a lacquer cup of sake floating towards them on the water.  When the cup reached the poet, they were expected to drink its contents, either as a celebration of the poem's completion or as a forfeit if they had not composed a suitable verse in time.  The first \"kyokusui-no-en\" events were reportedly held in the Kofun period during the reign of Emperor Kenz\u014d, making the ceremony around 1,500 years old.  Other sources, however, suggest that the game originated in the Heian period, around 500 years later; it appears in scrolls from that period and is mentioned in \"The Pillow Book\" of Sei Sh\u014dnagon.  There is also evidence of a Chinese version popularised by Wang Xizhi, which dates back as far as 353; poems composed at this event were recorded in Wang's famous work, the \"Lantingji Xu\". Panela: Panela (] , Portuguese: \"rapadura\" ] ) is unrefined whole cane sugar, typical of Central and of Latin America in general, which is a solid form of sucrose derived from the boiling and evaporation of sugarcane juice.  Panela is known by other names in Latin America, such as piloncillo in Mexico (where \"panela\" refers to a type of cheese, \"queso panela\").  The name \"piloncillo\" means \"little loaf\", because of the traditional shape in which this smoky, caramelly and earthy sugar is produced.  It has far more flavor than brown sugar, which is generally just white sugar with a small amount of molasses added back to it.  Just like brown sugar, there are two varieties of piloncillo; one is lighter (blanco) and one darker (oscuro).  Unrefined, it is commonly used in Mexico, where it has been around for at least 500 years.  Made from crushed sugar cane, the juice is collected, boiled and poured into molds, where it hardens into blocks.  Panela is also known as rapadura in Portuguese.  In Australia the locals have aptly named it \"Uluru Dust\" due to its brown colour, dusty texture and dirt-like taste.  Elsewhere in the world, the word jaggery describes a similar foodstuff.  Both of them are considered non-centrifugal cane sugars. Ruakuri Cave: Ruakuri Cave is the longest underground cave in the Waitomo area of New Zealand.  It was first discovered by local M\u0101ori between 400 and 500 years ago.

    "question": "Which has the larger population, Shanghai or Hanggin Rear Banner? Context: Shia Muslims in the Arab world: Islam is historically divided into two major sects, Sunni and Shia Islam, each with its own sub-sects.  Large numbers of Shia Arab Muslims live in some Arab countries including Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar.  Shia Muslims are a numerical majority in Iraq and Bahrain.  Approximately half of the population in Yemen are Shia Muslims.  Exactly half of Muslims in Lebanon are Shia Muslims.  There is also a very large population of Shia Muslims living in the Arab Persian Gulf countries especially in Saudi Arabia.  Approximately the whole population of East Saudi Arabia, the Eastern Province are Shia Muslims.  Although government statistics claim that roughly only 20-40% of the Muslim population are Shia Muslims, there has been dispute to the authenticity of this figure and recent reports and investigations indicate that there is in fact a much larger population of Shia Muslims present, with estimate figures over 45% or even making the majority of Muslim population.  Saudi Arabia follows a strict recently established sect of Islam, Wahhabism, there is little freedom of religion between the different sects even whilst all of the population are Muslims.  Smaller Shia groups are present in Egypt and Jordan.  Despite the heavy presence of Shia Muslims in some Arab countries, particularly among the population of the Persian Gulf Arab countries, they have been treated poorly throughout history.  Additionally, in recent times, Shia Muslims along with Kurds have faced genocide by the pan-Arabist regime of Saddam Hussein.  For both historical and political reasons, the Shia have fared rather poorly in much of the Arab world, and the topic of Shi\u2018ism and Shia groups is one of the most sensitive issues for the Sunni elite.  This article discusses both the history of Sh\u012b\u2018a Islam in the Arab world from the dawn of Islam and their current situation in the Arabic-speaking world.

    "question": "What substance is always in a trap to prevent the passage of anything from either direction,  even sewer gases?  Context: Trap (plumbing): In plumbing, a trap is a device which has a shape that uses a bending path to capture water to prevent sewer gases from entering buildings, while allowing waste to pass through.  In refinery applications, traps are used to prevent hydrocarbons and other dangerous gases from escaping outside through drains. Maekawa's theorem: Maekawa's theorem is a theorem in the mathematics of paper folding named after Jun Maekawa.  It relates to flat-foldable origami crease patterns and states that at every vertex, the numbers of valley and mountain folds always differ by two in either direction.  The same result was also discovered by Jacques Justin and, even earlier, by S. Murata. Berri Street: Berri Street (officially in French: rue Berri ) is a major north-south street located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Berri Street links De la Commune Street in the south and Somerville Street in the north.  The street is interrupted between Rosemont Boulevard and Jean Talon Street.  Berri Street has two lanes in either direction from De la Commune Street to Roy Street.  It changes to one lane in either direction north of Roy Street.  The street runs through two small tunnels, one underneath Notre-Dame Street and one underneath Sherbrooke Street.  Berri Street has a bicycle lane from De la Commune Street to Sherbrooke Street. Pieterpad: The Pieterpad is a long distance walking route in the Netherlands.  The trail runs 498 km from Pieterburen, in the northern part of Groningen, south through the eastern part of the Netherlands to end just south of Maastricht, on the top of Mount Saint Peter (\"St Pietersberg\"), at a height of 109 m .  The Pieterpad is one of the official Long Distance Paths in the Netherlands (Lange Afstand Wandelpad Nummer 9) and by far the most popular of its long distance walking routes.  It is possible to walk the route in either direction, and throughout the year.  It is well signposted, and is well served by public transport and accommodation throughout its length.  The official guide book is in two volumes, Pieterburen-Vorden and Vorden-Maastricht.  A dedicated website (in Dutch) also gives updated accommodation details.  Although the walking is always easy and never remote, it is a varied and often beautiful walk, passing through woods, polders, heathland, and numerous small Dutch villages. Tapsel gate: A Tapsel gate is a type of wooden gate, unique to the English county of Sussex, which has a central pivot upon which it can rotate through 90\u00b0 in either direction before coming to a stop at two fixed points.  It was named after a Sussex family of bell-founders, one of whom invented it in the late 18th century.  Only six examples survive, all within a 10 mi radius of Lewes, the county town of Sussex.  Tapsel gates have the dual advantage of keeping cattle out of churchyards and allowing the efficient passage of coffins carried to and from the church during burials.  The name sometimes is used more generally to describe swivelling gates of a similar design elsewhere. Buchan trap: A Buchan Trap (alternative names: \"Bristol interceptor\", \"interceptor trap\" and \"disconnecting trap\") is a device made from fireclay located in a domestic sewer pipe to prevent vermin entering the pipe.  The trap uses a water seal to prevent rats and mice climbing any further along the pipe.  Waste flows from the house through a U-bend in the trap.  This means that there is always water in the pipe preventing the passage of anything from the other direction.  The device is a large clay U-bend with air-inlets and vents at the top.  It is located below the ground level, but can be accessed through the air-inlet and a rodding hole.  This hole allows drain rods to unblock anything located at the bottom of the U-bend. Sewer gas destructor lamp: The main purpose of a sewer gas destructor lamp is to remove sewer gases and their hazards. Alexander Cumming: Alexhander Cumming (sometimes referred to as Alexander Cummings) FRSE (1733 \u20138 March 1814) was a Scottish watchmaker and instrument inventor, who was the first to patent a design of the flush toilet, that had been invented by Sir John Harrington.  The S-trap (or bend) was invented by Cumming in 1775 to retain water permanently within the bowl, thus preventing sewer gases from entering buildings.  It survives in today's plumbing modified as a U- or J-shaped pipe trap located below or within a plumbing fixture. Specific gravity: Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance; equivalently, it is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of a reference substance for the same given volume.  \"Apparent\" specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the reference substance.  The reference substance is nearly always water at its densest (4\u00b0C) for liquids; for gases it is air at room temperature (25\u00b0C).  Nonetheless, the temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference.  Pressure is nearly always 1 atm (101.325 kPa).  Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry.  In British beer brewing, the practice for specific gravity as specified above is to multiply it by 1000.  Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as brines, hydrocarbons, sugar solutions (syrups, juices, honeys, brewers wort, must etc.) and acids. Trap primer: A trap primer (or trap seal primer) is a plumbing device or valve that adds water to traps.  The water seals in traps are needed to prevent sewer gases from entering buildings, but because this water is exposed to the air, it is subject to evaporation over time in infrequently used floor drains, leading to the release of sewer gas into the environment.  The trap primer mitigates this problem by injecting water, either directly or indirectly, into the trap to maintain the water seal indefinitely."

    "question": "Are the flowering plants Ecballium and Elatostema in the same family? Context: Basal angiosperms: The basal angiosperms are the flowering plants which diverged from the lineage leading to most flowering plants.  In particular, the most basal angiosperms were called the ANITA grade which is made up of \"Amborella\" (a single species of shrub from New Caledonia), Nymphaeales (water lilies, together with some other aquatic plants) and Austrobaileyales (woody aromatic plants including star anise).  ANITA stands for \"Amborella\", Nymphaeales and Illiciales, Trimeniaceae-\"Austrobaileya\".  Some authors have shortened this to ANA-grade for the three orders, Amborellales, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales, as the order Illiciales was reduced to the family Illiciaceae and placed, along with the family Trimeniaceae, within the Austrobaileyales. Austrobaileyales: Austrobaileyales is an order of flowering plants, consisting of about 100 species of woody plants growing as trees, shrubs and lianas.  Perhaps the most familiar species is \"Illicium verum\", from which comes the spice star anise.  The order belongs to the group of basal angiosperms, the ANA grade, which diverged earlier from the remaining flowering plants, and, as such, it is the extant group after the Amborellales and Nymphaeales, that is sister to all remaining extant angiosperms outside of the ANA grade.  The order includes just three families of flowering plants, the Austrobaileyaceae, a monotypic family containing the sole genus, \"Austrobaileya scandens\", a woody liana, the Schisandraceae, a family of trees, shrubs, or lianas containing essential oils, and the Trimeniaceae, essential oil-bearing trees and lianas. Elatostema: Elatostema is a genus of flowering plants containing approximately 350 known species in the nettle family Urticaceae, native to tropical forest clearings throughout Australasia, Asia and Africa.  There may be as many as 1,000 species of this little-known genus, which is susceptible to deforestation and other forms of human exploitation.  Some species, for instance the recently discovered \"E. fengshanense\", show unusual adaptations to growing in deep shade in caves.  DNA analysis suggests that the three genera \"Elastostema\", \"Pellionia\", and \"Pilea\" be grouped together as one. Pterostylis lineata: Pterostylis lineata, commonly known as the Blue Mountains leafy greenhood, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to New South Wales.  As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering.  The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves on a short stalk but the flowering plants lack a rosette and have up to seven dark green flowers with translucent \"windows\" on a flowering stem with stem leaves.  The labellum is light brown with a black strip along its mid-line. Chloranthaceae: Chloranthaceae is a family of flowering plants (angiosperms), the only family in the order Chloranthales.  It is not closely related to any other family of flowering plants, and is among the early-diverging lineages in the angiosperms.  They are woody or weakly woody plants occurring in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Madagascar, Central and South America, and the West Indies.  The family consists of four extant genera, totalling about 77 known species according to Christenhusz and Byng in 2016.  Some species are used in traditional medicine.  The type genus is \"Chloranthus\". Pterostylis crassa: Pterostylis crassa, commonly known as the coarse leafy greenhood, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to Victoria.  As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering.  The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves on a short stalk but the flowering plants have up to four relatively large, shiny dark green translucent flowers on a flowering stem with stem leaves. Pterostylis chocolatina: Pterostylis chocolatina, commonly known as the chocolate-lip leafy greenhood, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to New South Wales.  As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering.  The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves on a short stalk but the flowering plants lack a rosette and have up to thirteen green flowers on a flowering stem with stem leaves.  The labellum is dark brown with a blackish lump near its base. Ecballium: Ecballium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae containing a single species, Ecballium elaterium, also called the squirting cucumber or exploding cucumber (but not to be confused with \"Cyclanthera explodens\").  It gets its unusual name from the fact that, when ripe, it squirts a stream of mucilaginous liquid containing its seeds, which can be seen with the naked eye.  It is thus considered to have rapid plant movement. Pterostylis diminuta: Pterostylis diminuta, commonly known as the small-flowered leafy greenhood, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to Victoria.  As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering.  The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have up to twelve small, partly green, partly translucent flowers and lack a rosette. Pterostylis barringtonensis: Pterostylis barringtonensis, commonly known as the Barrington leafy greenhood, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to New South Wales.  As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering.  The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves on a short stalk but the flowering plants lack a rosette and have up to seven dark green flowers on a flowering stem with stem leaves.  It is only known from Barrington Tops National Park."

Tennis New Zealand: The history of tennis in New Zealand dates back to the 1870s, the decade when the development of modern tennis began.  The first \"New Zealand Tennis Championships\" were played at Farndon in Hawkes Bay in 1886.  New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association (NZLTA) was formed at a meeting held in Hastings in December 1886.  Shortly after its inauguration, the New Zealand Association became affiliated with the Lawn Tennis Association (England).  In 1904 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association amalgamated with six Australian state tennis associations to form the Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia.  New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association played a significant role in the origin of the Australian Open.  Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia created the tournament called \"The Australasian Mens Championships\" (which later became Australian Open) in 1905 and was first played in Warehouseman's Cricket Ground and it was decided that championships would be hosted by both Australian as well as New Zealand venues.  New Zealand hosted the championship twice\u2014 Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912).  The geographical remoteness of both the countries (Australia and New Zealand) made it difficult for foreign players to enter the tournament.  In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended, and the tournament was won by a New Zealander (Tony Wilding).  Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia was one of the twelve national associations of tennis which established the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in a conference in Paris, France on 1 March 1913.  From 1905 until 1919, New Zealand and Australian tennis players participated in the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (Davis Cup) under the alias of \"Team Australasia\", the team claimed a title six times (1907, 1908, 1909, 1911, 1914, 1919), however, there were attempts to severance this trans-tasmanian partnership, in order to allow New Zealand players to represent their nation on international tennis events.  In 1922, New Zealand dropped out from this partnership and on 16 March 1923 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association was granted affiliation to the International Lawn Tennis Association and thereby became eligible to enter the International Lawn Tennis Challenge in its own right.  New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association filed its first challenge with United States Lawn Tennis Association for 1924 International Lawn Tennis Challenge.  Tennis New Zealand was the founding member of Oceania Tennis Federation in 1993."

    "question": "Out of two American colonies that had a series of skirmishes and raids between 1701 and 1765 at the disputed border, which British proprietary colony became a royal colony on the northeast coast of North America? Context: Canada under British rule: Canada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.  Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom. Stamp Act Congress: The Stamp Act Congress or First Congress of the American Colonies was a meeting held between October 7 and 25, 1765 in New York City, consisting of representatives from some of the British colonies in North America; it was the first gathering of elected representatives from several of the American colonies to devise a unified protest against new British taxation.  Parliament had passed the Stamp Act, which required the use of specially stamped paper for legal documents, playing cards, calendars, newspapers and dice for virtually all business in the colonies, and was going into effect on November 1. Province of New Jersey: The Province of New Jersey was one of the Middle Colonies of Colonial America and became the U.S. state of New Jersey in 1776.  The province had originally been settled by Europeans as part of New Netherland, but came under English rule after the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, becoming a proprietary colony.  The English then renamed the province after the Isle of Jersey in the English Channel.  The Dutch Republic reasserted control for a brief period in 1673\u20131674.  After that it consisted of two political divisions, East Jersey and West Jersey, until they were united as a royal colony in 1702.  The original boundaries of the province were slightly larger than the current state, extending into a part of the present state of New York, until the border was finalized in 1773. Province of Pennsylvania: The Province of Pennsylvania, also known as the Pennsylvania Colony, was founded in English North America by William Penn on March 4, 1681 as dictated in a royal charter granted by King Charles II.  The name Pennsylvania, which translates roughly as \"Penn's Woods\", was created by combining the Penn surname (in honor of William's father, Admiral Sir William Penn) with the Latin word \"sylvania\", meaning \"forest land.\"  The Province of Pennsylvania was one of the two major Restoration colonies, the other being the Province of Carolina.  The proprietary colony's charter remained in the hands of the Penn family until the American Revolution, when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was created and became one of the original thirteen states. Province of New York: The Province of New York (1664\u20131776) was a British proprietary colony and later royal colony on the northeast coast of North America.  As one of the Thirteen Colonies, New York achieved independence and worked with the others to found the United States. Stamp Act 1765: The Stamp Act of 1765 (short title \"Duties in American Colonies Act 1765\"; 5 George III, c. 12) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain that imposed a direct tax on the colonies of British America and required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp.  Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies.  Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money.  The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years' War and its North American theater of the French and Indian War.  The Americans said that there was no military need for the soldiers because there were no foreign enemies on the continent, and the Americans had always protected themselves against Indians.  They suggested that it was actually a matter of British patronage to surplus British officers and career soldiers who should be paid by London. History of the New Jersey State Constitution: Originally, the state of New Jersey was a single British colony, the Province of New Jersey.  After the English Civil War, Charles II assigned New Jersey as a proprietary colony to be held jointly by Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton.  Eventually, the collection of land fees, or quit-rents, from colonists proved inadequate for colonial profitability.  Sir George Carteret sold his share of the colony to the Quakers in 1673.  Following the sale, the land was divided into East and West Jersey.  In 1681, West Jersey adopted a constitution.  In 1683, East Jersey adopted one as well.  In 1702, the colonies were united again under Anne, Queen of Great Britain, and adopted a constitution in 1776. Charter colony: Charter colony is one of three classes of colonial government established in the 17th century English colonies in North America, the other classes being proprietary colony and royal colony.  The colonies of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts Bay were charter colonies.  In a charter colony, Britain granted a charter to the colonial government establishing the rules under which the colony was to be governed.  The charters of Rhode Island and Connecticut granted the colonists significantly more political liberty than other colonies.  Rhode Island and Connecticut continued to use their colonial charters as their State constitutions after the American Revolution. New York \u2013 New Jersey Line War: The New York \u2013 New Jersey Line War (also known as the N.J. Line War) refers to a series of skirmishes and raids that took place for over half a century between 1701 and 1765 at the disputed border between two American colonies, the Province of New York and the Province of New Jersey. Proprietary colony: A proprietary colony was a type of British colony mostly in North America and the Caribbean in the 17th century.  In the British Empire, all land belonged to the ruler, and it was his prerogative to divide.  Therefore, all colonial properties were partitioned by royal charter into one of four types: proprietary, royal, joint stock, or covenant.  King Charles II used the proprietary solution to reward allies and focus his own attention on Britain itself.  He offered his friends colonial charters which facilitated private investment and colonial self-government.  The charters made the proprietor the effective ruler, albeit one ultimately responsible to English law and the king.  Charles II gave New Netherland to his younger brother The Duke of York, who named it New York.  He gave an area to William Penn who named it Pennsylvania."

    "question": "The 1991\u201392 NBA season included an Achilles tendon injury to which nine-time NBA All-Star? Context: 1991\u201392 Boston Celtics season: The 1991\u201392 NBA season was the 46th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association.  This marked the final NBA season for All-Star forward Larry Bird, who missed nearly half of the season games due to a nagging back injury.  However, one of the season highlights was a 49-point performance from Bird in a nationally televised double-overtime win over eventual Western Conference champion Portland Trail Blazers.  It was the most points for Bird since February 15, 1988, when he scored 49 at Phoenix Suns.  Bird was also selected for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game along with Reggie Lewis, but did not play due to injury. Matt Prior: Matthew James \"Matt\" Prior (born 26 February 1982) is a former English international cricketer who played for England in Test cricket and for Sussex in domestic cricket.  He was a wicket-keeper, and his aggressive right-handed batting enabled him to open the innings in ODI matches, even when he made very limited appearance in shorter forms of the game.  With an international Test debut score of 126, Prior became the first English wicket-keeper to hit a century in his debut match in early 2007.  His glovework, however, was criticised.  Despite a successful tour of Sri Lanka with the bat, Prior's keeping was less successful, and he was dropped from the team for the 2008 tour of New Zealand.  He returned for the 2008 series against South Africa, and was retained into 2009, where he became the second-fastest England keeper to reach 1,000 Test runs, behind Les Ames.  In his role as wicketkeeper, Prior has been described as 'a big talker behind the stumps' but has argued that this approach is different from the behaviour that saw him criticised during the 2007 tour by India; 'Ninety-five percent of the time, my chat is about geeing up our bowlers and the fielding unit.'  He retired in June 2015 from all forms of professional cricket due to a recurring Achilles tendon injury. Gilberto (Angolan footballer): Felisberto Sebasti\u00e3o da Gra\u00e7a Amaral, more commonly known as Gilberto (born 21 September 1982), is a retired Angolan footballer.

He was part of the Angolan national team during the 2008 African Cup of Nations in Ghana. Tendinitis: Tendinitis (also tendonitis), meaning inflammation of a tendon, is a type of tendinopathy often confused with the more common tendinosis, which has similar symptoms but requires different treatment.

The term tendinitis is generally reserved for tendon injuries that involve larger-scale acute injuries accompanied by inflammation.  Tendinitis is typically referred to in combination with the body part involved, such as Achilles tendinitis (affecting the Achilles tendon), or patellar tendinitis (jumper's knee, affecting the patellar tendon). 1977\u201378 Buffalo Braves season: The 1977\u201378 NBA season was the Braves' eighth and final season in the NBA.

However, with a 22\u201320 record in late January, Dominique Wilkins ruptured his achilles tendon and was out for the remainder of the season.  Without Wilkins, the Hawks would lose 24 of their final 40 games, including a 7-game losing streak.

During the offseason, the Pacers acquired Jalen Rose from the Denver Nuggets.  Injuries and sluggish play would hamper the Pacers all season long as Rik Smits only played just 52 games due to a foot injury, and Derrick McKey appeared in just 50 games due to a ruptured Achilles tendon.  They missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years with a disappointing 39\u201343 record, sixth in the Central Division.  Reggie Miller averaged 21.6 points per game and led the league with 229 three-point field goals.

    "question": "\"The Empire Builder\"'s Columbia River Subdivision was part of which line? Context: Castleton Subdivision: The Castleton Subdivision is a railroad line owned and operated by CSX Transportation in the U.S. state of New York.  The line runs from Schodack northwest to Selkirk along a former New York Central Railroad line.  At its southeast end, it junctions with the Berkshire Subdivision and Schodack Subdivision.  After crossing the Hudson River on the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge, it meets the River Subdivision and Port Subdivision at Selkirk and ends at Selkirk Yard, where the Selkirk Subdivision begins. Nashville Terminal Subdivision: The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. Columbia River Subdivision: The Columbia River Subdivision or Columbia River Sub is a railway line running about 167 mi from Wenatchee to Spokane, Washington.

It includes nearly 500 mi of the Columbia River, as well as the lower reaches of major tributaries such as the Snake and Yakima rivers and the associated drainage basins.  It is named for the Columbia River Plateau, a flood basalt plateau formed by the Columbia River Basalt Group during the late Miocene and early Pliocene.  The arid sagebrush steppe and grasslands of the region are flanked by moister, predominantly forested, mountainous ecoregions on all sides.  The underlying basalt is up to 2 mi thick and partially covered by thick loess desposits.  Where precipitation amounts are sufficient, the deep loess soils have been extensively cultivated for wheat.  Water from the Columbia River is subject to resource allocation debates involving fisheries, navigation, hydropower, recreation, and irrigation, and the Columbia Basin Project has dramatically converted much of the region to agricultural use."

    "question": "Barranca de Yaco is a geographical feature along an ancient road that is approximately how many miles long? Context: Dewberry Island: Dewberry Island is an island located in Calhoun County, Texas, in the United States.  It is northeast of the Matagorda Island Wildlife Refuge, and on the northern side of Shoalwater Bay, in the U.S. state of Texas.  It is several miles long and is an extension of the nearby Blackberry Island.  Dewberry Island is located near a geographical feature known as the Army Cut. Castle Hedingham: Castle Hedingham is a village in northeast Essex, England, located four miles west of Halstead and 3 miles south-east of Great Yeldham in the Colne Valley on the ancient road from Colchester, Essex, to Cambridge. Rock shelter: A rock shelter \u2014 also rockhouse, crepuscular cave, bluff shelter, or abri \u2014 is a shallow cave-like opening at the base of a bluff or cliff.  In contrast to solutional cave (karst) caves, which are often many miles long, rock shelters are almost always modest in size and extent. Via Labicana: The Via Labicana was an ancient road of Italy, leading east-southeast from Rome.  It seems possible that the road at first led to Tusculum, that it was then extended to Labici, and later still became a road for through traffic; it may even have superseded the Via Latina as a route to the southeast, for, while the distance from Rome to their main junction at Ad Bivium (or to another junction at Compitum Anagninum) is practically identical, the summit level of the former is 22 m lower than that of the latter, a little to the west of the pass of Mons Algidus.  After their junction it is probable that the road bore the name Via Latina rather than Via Labicana.  The course of the road after the first six miles from Rome is not identical with that of any modern road, but can be clearly traced by remains of pavement and buildings along its course. Banff Bay: Banff Bay is a coastal embayment in Scotland situated between the towns of Banff, Aberdeenshire and Macduff, Aberdeenshire.

    "question": "Bridget Cromwell is the eldest daughter of an English military and political leader and later Lord Protector of what commonwealths? Context: Elizabeth Claypole: Elizabeth Claypole (\"n\u00e9e\" Cromwell; 2 July 1629 \u2013 6 August 1658) was the second daughter of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and his wife, Elizabeth Cromwell, and reportedly interceded with her father for royalist prisoners.  After Cromwell created a peerage for her husband, John Claypole, she was known as Lady Claypole.  She was buried in Westminster Abbey. Cromwell family: The Cromwell family is an English aristocratic family.  Its most famous members are: Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, and Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector.  The line of Oliver Cromwell descends from Richard Williams (alias Cromwell), son of Thomas Cromwell's sister Katherine and her husband Morgan Williams. The Protectorate: The Protectorate was the period during the Commonwealth (or, to monarchists, the Interregnum) when England and Wales, Ireland and Scotland were governed by a Lord Protector.  The Protectorate began in 1653 when, following the dissolution of the Rump Parliament and then Barebone's Parliament, Oliver Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector of the Commonwealth under the terms of the Instrument of Government.  In 1659 the Protectorate Parliament was dissolved by the Committee of Safety as Richard Cromwell, who had succeeded his father as Lord Protector, was unable to keep control of the Parliament and the Army.  This marked the end of the Protectorate and the start of a second period of rule by the Rump Parliament as the legislature and the Council of State as the executive. Oliver Cromwell: Oliver Cromwell (25 April 15993 September 1658) was an English military and political leader and later Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Oliver Cromwell (disambiguation): Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658) was an English military and political leader and later Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland. Clere baronets: The Clere Baronetcy, of Ormesby in the County of Norfolk, was a title in the Baronetage of England.  It was created on 26 February 1621 for Sir Henry Clere.  His only son by his wife Muriel Mundefod died in infancy and the title became extinct on his early death in 1622.  He had one daughter Abigail, who married John Williams, otherwise Cromwell, second son of Sir Oliver Cromwell, and first cousin of the Lord Protector  Oliver Cromwell, by who she had two children Haing separated from her husband she became an actress, and the mistress of William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker, as such she is known to readers of the Diary of Samuel Pepys as \"Madam Williams\".  Pepys strongly disapproved of the affair, but it endured until Lord Brouncker's death in 1684, and he left Abigail much of his property. Bridget Cromwell: Bridget Cromwell (1624 - 1662) was Oliver Cromwell's eldest daughter.  She married General Henry Ireton and after he died General Charles Fleetwood. Cromwell (disambiguation): Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658) was an English military and political leader and later Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland. Oliver Cromwell's head: Following the death of Oliver Cromwell on 3 September 1658, he was given a public funeral at Westminster Abbey equal to those of monarchy before him.  After the defeat of King Charles I in the English Civil War and Charles' subsequent beheading, Cromwell had become Lord Protector and ruler of the English Commonwealth.  His legacy passed to his son Richard, who was overthrown by the army in 1659, after which monarchy was re-established and King Charles II, who was living in exile, was recalled.  Charles' new parliament ordered the disinterment of Cromwell's body from Westminster Abbey and the disinterment of other regicides John Bradshaw and Henry Ireton, for a posthumous execution at Tyburn.  After hanging \"from morning till four in the afternoon\", the bodies were cut down and the heads placed on a 20 foot spike above Westminster Hall (the location of the trial of Charles I).  In 1685 a storm broke the pole upon which Cromwell's head stood, throwing it to the ground (although other sources put the date anywhere between 1672 and 1703 ), after which it was in the hands of private collectors and museum owners until 25 March 1960, when it was buried at Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge. Oliver Cromwell in popular culture: Oliver Cromwell (25 April 1599\u00a0\u2013 3 September 1658) was an English military and political leader and later Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland."

Co-produced by Andrew Murdock, \"City of Evil\" contains a more traditional heavy metal and hard rock sound than Avenged Sevenfold's previous two albums, which showcased a predominantly metalcore sound.  The album is also notable for the absence of screaming vocals.  M. Shadows worked for months before the album's release with vocal coach Ron Anderson, whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell, to achieve a sound that had \"grit while still having the tone\".

Context: USS Lewis and Clark (SSBN-644): USS \"Lewis and Clark\" (SSBN-644), a \"Benjamin Franklin\"\u00a0class ballistic missile submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the explorers Meriwether Lewis (1774\u20131809) and William Clark (1770\u20131838), who carried out the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804\u201306. Lewis and Clark River: The Lewis and Clark River is a tributary of Youngs River, approximately 20 mi long, in northwest Oregon in the United States.  It drains 62 sqmi of the Northern Oregon Coast Range in the extreme northwest corner of the state, entering Youngs River just above its mouth on the Columbia River at Youngs Bay.  Near the river's mouth is the site of former Fort Clatsop of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  The river is named for Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Lewis and Clark Memorial Column: The Lewis and Clark Memorial Column is an outdoor monument by artist Otto Schumann, dedicated to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark for their expedition and located at Washington Park in Portland, Oregon. Tavern Cave: Tavern Cave, also known as the Taverne-A Cave, is a historic archaeological site located near St. Albans, Franklin County, Missouri.  Meriwether Lewis and William Clark visited Tavern Cave on May 23, 1804 at the beginning of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  The cave includes a petroglyph of either a canoe or a historic flat boat and several 19th century era inscriptions. Lewis and Clark Expedition: The Lewis and Clark Expedition from May 1804 to September 1806, also known as the Corps of Discovery Expedition, was the first American expedition to cross what is now the western portion of the United States.  It began near St. Louis, made its way westward, and passed through the continental divide to reach the Pacific coast.  The Corps of Discovery comprised a selected group of U.S. Army volunteers under the command of Captain Meriwether Lewis and his close friend, Second Lieutenant William Clark. Undaunted Courage: Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West (ISBN\u00a0 ), written by Stephen Ambrose, is a 1996 biography of Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  The book is based on journals and letters written by Lewis, William Clark, Thomas Jefferson and the members of the Corps of Discovery.  While most of the book is dedicated to the expedition, several chapters are also devoted to Lewis's early life as a Virginia planter and Jefferson's personal secretary, and his later life as governor of the Louisiana Territory before his untimely death in 1809. John Shields (explorer): Private John Shields (c1769\u20131809) was, at about 35 years old, the second oldest member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and its oldest enlisted member.  Shields, born in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, moved at about 14 years old to the wilderness of Tennessee, helped build and lived in a family fort that provided protection from Native Americans, traveled with Captain Meriwether Lewis, Second Lieutenant William Clark, and Native American Sacagawea to the Oregon Coast where he helped build Fort Clatsop, and then returned to St. Louis, Missouri.  At the completion of this great adventure Shields hunted and trapped with the famous American pioneer Daniel Boone. Lewis and Clark Pass (Montana): Lewis and Clark Pass, el.  6424 ft is a mountain pass on the continental divide in Montana.  It lies at the head of the drainages of the west flowing Blackfoot River and the east flowing Dearborn River.  The pass is in the Helena National Forest in Lewis and Clark County.  The Continental Divide Trail traverses north and south through the pass.  At the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition the pass was a much-used pathway where the native people living in what today is Montana crossed over the continental divide.  The pass was crossed by Meriwether Lewis on July 7, 1806, on the return leg of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with a party of nine men and his dog Seaman.  The pass was named for the expedition's two leaders\u2013Lewis and William Clark.  Lewis and Clark Pass is the only roadless pass on the entire Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.  It has gone from being one of the most used continental divide passes prior to the pioneer era to one of the least visited passes today.  It can be accessed by a 1.5 mi trail.  Visitors will encounter the pass much as Lewis did in 1806.  The furrows left by the countless dog and horse travois that crossed the pass are still visible (though fading) and this is one of the places along the expedition's route that visitors may still encounter a grizzly bear.  On a clear day, like Meriwether Lewis in 1806 one can see Square Butte in Cascade County, Montana, 40 mi to the northeast. Meriwether Lewis: Meriwether Lewis (August 18, 1774 \u2013 October 11, 1809) was an American explorer, soldier, politician, and public administrator, best known for his role as the leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, also known as the Corps of Discovery, with William Clark.

    "question": "What Andy Williams' album did a song written by Charles Wesley appear on? Context: Andy Williams' Greatest Hits: Andy Williams' Greatest Hits is a compilation album by American pop singer Andy Williams that was released in early 1970 by Columbia Records.  It was not, however, as its title might suggest, strictly a hit singles compilation, although some of his biggest songs since joining Columbia (such as the easy listening number ones \"Can't Get Used to Losing You\" and \"Happy Heart\") were included.  A couple of selections (\"Born Free\" and \"More\") were never released as singles by Williams, and his signature song, \"Moon River\", was released in the 7-inch single format but only for jukeboxes.  His six Cadence singles that made the Top 10 on \"Billboard\" magazine's Hot 100 are passed over for the inclusion of his number 11 hit from that label, \"The Hawaiian Wedding Song\", and 17 of his Columbia recordings that made the Hot 100 up until 1970 are left out here in favor of \"Charade\", which spent its one week on the chart at number 100. Andy Williams Sings Steve Allen: Andy Williams Sings Steve Allen is an album by American pop singer Andy Williams that was released late in 1956 by Cadence Records.  This was his first LP and features songs written or co-written by then-\"Tonight Show\" host Steve Allen.  The review of the album in the December 22 issue of \"The Billboard\" that year reads, \"Cover shows only a photo of the singer with no copy and it might have been a better bet to identify the personality.\"  The cover of the 1960 reissue of the album attempts to rectify this situation with the title presented in two lines of large capital letters that sandwich a headshot of Williams this time instead of the seated pose of the original. We Need a Little Christmas (album): We Need a Little Christmas is a Christmas album by American pop singer Andy Williams that was released by Unison Music in 1995.  It gives an adult contemporary treatment to songs that Williams had previously recorded for 1963's \"The Andy Williams Christmas Album\" (\"Away In A Manger\", \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)\", \"It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year\", \"Silent Night\"), 1965's \"Merry Christmas\" (\"Mary's Little Boy Child\"), 1974's \"Christmas Present\" (\"Angels We Have Heard On High\", \"Hark!  The Herald Angels Sing\", \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\", \"What Child Is This\"), and 1990's \"I Still Believe in Santa Claus\" (\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\") and includes three songs that Williams had not recorded before.  In a brief note on the back of the jewel case Williams writes, \"These all-new recordings feature fresh, innovative arrangements of some of my favorite carols.  I felt like I was singing them for the very first time.\" Happy Heart: \"Happy Heart\" is a song written by James Last and Jackie Rae.  Versions of the song Petula Clark and Andy Williams charted simultaneously in 1969 and had their best showings on \"Billboard\" magazine's Easy Listening chart, where Clark peaked at number 12 and Williams spent two weeks at number one. Hawaiian Wedding Song: \"Hawaiian Wedding Song\" is a traditional pop music song recorded by singer Andy Williams in 1959.  It was adapted from a 1926 love song written by Charles E. King for his operetta, \"The Prince of Hawaii\".  Originally titled \"Ke Kali Nei Au\" (Hawaiian for \"Waiting Here for You\"), Al Hoffman and Dick Manning translated the original Hawaiian words into English and renamed it \"Hawaiian Wedding Song\". Dear Heart (song): \"Dear Heart\" is a song written by Henry Mancini, Ray Evans, and Jay Livingston and performed by Andy Williams.  The song reached #2 on the U.S. adult contemporary chart and #24 on the \"Billboard\" chart in 1964.  It appears on the 1965 Andy Williams album, \"Andy Williams' Dear Heart\". Get Together with Andy Williams: Get Together with Andy Williams is an album by American pop singer Andy Williams that was released on October 6, 1969, by Columbia Records and contained covers of recent hits.

Andy Williams recorded the song with English lyrics, reaching #92 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #18 in the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart in 1965.  Also receiving air-play, contemporaneously with Andy Williams' recording of \"Quiet Nights,\" was Kitty Kallen's version.  Her album, titled \"Quiet Nights,\" was released by 20th Century-Fox Records in 1964. It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year: \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" is a popular Christmas song written in triple time in 1963 by Edward Pola and George Wyle.  It was recorded and released that year by pop singer Andy Williams for his first Christmas album, \"The Andy Williams Christmas Album\".  However, the song was not released as a promotional single by Williams' record label (Columbia Records) that year, as they instead opted to promote his cover of \"White Christmas\" as the official promo single from the album."

    "question": "From which country is the largest known example of European Iron Age silver work? Context: La T\u00e8ne culture: The La T\u00e8ne culture ( ; ] ) was a European Iron Age culture named after the archaeological site of La T\u00e8ne on the north side of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland, where thousands of objects had been deposited in the lake, as was discovered after the water level dropped in 1857. Cordoba Treasure: The Cordoba Treasure, or \"Tesoro de C\u00f3rdoba\" in Spanish, is the name of a major Iron Age silver hoard found on the outskirts of the city of C\u00f3rdoba, Spain in 1915.  The entire treasure was purchased by the British Museum in 1932, where it has been on public display ever since. Zierscheibe: Zierscheibe (German for \"ornamental disk\") in archaeology is the term for a kind of metal jewellery dating to the European Iron Age.  They are found in women's graves and are thought to have been worn as pendants attached to the tunica, or as part of a belt pouch. Bridge-spouted vessel: A bridge-spouted vessel is a particular design of ewer (jug or pitcher) originating in antiquity; there is typically a connecting element between the spout and filling aperture, and the spout is a completely independent aperture from the usually smaller central fill opening.  Early incidences of the bridge spouted vessel are found in Persia in the early Iron Age and on Crete.  This type of vessel typically appears in the Bronze Age or early Iron Age.  A very early example of a bridge spouted bowl has been recovered at the ancient palace of Phaistos on Crete, dating to the Bronze Age. Gundestrup cauldron: The Gundestrup cauldron is a richly decorated silver vessel, thought to date from between 200 BC and 300 AD, or more narrowly between 150 BC and 1 BC.  This places it within the late La T\u00e8ne period or early Roman Iron Age.  The cauldron is the largest known example of European Iron Age silver work (diameter: 69 cm ; height: 42 cm ).  It was found dismantled, with the other pieces stacked inside the base, in 1891 in a peat bog near the hamlet of Gundestrup in the Aars parish of Himmerland, Denmark ( ).  It is now usually on display in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, with replicas at other museums; during 2015-16 it was in the UK on a travelling exhibition called \"The Celts\". Architecture of Karnataka: The antiquity of Architecture of Karnataka(Kannada: \u0c95\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0cbe\u0c9f\u0c95 \u0cb5\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0cc1\u0cb6\u0cbf\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0caa ) can be traced to its southern Neolithic and early Iron Age, Having witnessed the architectural ideological and utilitarian transformation from shelter- ritual- religion.  Here the nomenclature \u2018Architecture\u2019 is as old as c.2000 B.C.E.  The upper or late Neolithic people in order to make their shelters, they constructed huts made of wattle and doab, that were buttressed by stone boulders, presumably having conical roof resting on the bamboo or wooden posts into red murram or paved granite chips as revealed in archaeological excavations in sites like Brhamagiri (Chitradurga district), Sanganakallu, Tekkalakota (Bellary district), Piklihal (Raichur district).  Megaliths are the dominant archaeological evidence of the early Iron Age (c. 1500 B.C.E- 100 C.E unsettled date).  There are more than 2000 early Iron Age burial sites on record, who laid the foundation for a high non perishable architecture in the form of various distinct architectural styles of stone built burials, which are ritualistic in its character.  The active religious architecture is evident 345 with that of the Kadamba Dynasty.  Karnataka is a state in the southern part of India originally known as the State of Mysore.  Over the centuries, architectural monuments within the region displayed a diversity of influences, often relaying much about the artistic trends of the rulers of twelve different dynasties.  Its architecture ranges dramatically from majestic monolith, such as the Gomateshwara, to Hindu and Jain places of worship, ruins of ancient cities, mausoleums and palaces of different architectural hue.  Mysore Kingdom (Wodeyar) rule has also given an architectural master structure in the St. Philomena's Church at Mysore (extolled by the King as a structure of divine compassion and the eager gratitude of men) which was completed in 1956, in addition to many Dravidian style architectural temples.  Two of the monuments (Pattadakal and Hampi) are listed under the UNESCO World Heritage List of 22 cultural monuments in India.  Styles of Indo-Saracenic, Renaissance, Corinthian, Hindu, Indo-Greek and Indo-British style palaces were built in Mysore, the city of palaces.  Sikh architecture at Bidar (1512) and also in Bangalore in 1956 can also be cited as having an impact on the architectural composition of the state. Torc: A torc, also spelled torq or torque, is a large rigid or stiff neck ring in metal, made either as a single piece or from strands twisted together.  The great majority are open at the front, although some had hook and ring closures and a few had mortice and tenon locking catches to close them.  Many seem designed for near-permanent wear and would have been difficult to remove.  Torcs are found in the Scythian, Illyrian Thracian, Celtic, and other cultures of the European Iron Age from around the 8th century\u00a0BC to the 3rd century\u00a0AD.  For the Iron Age Celts the gold torc seems to have been a key object, identifying the wearer as a person of high rank, and many of the finest works of ancient Celtic art are torcs.  The Celtic torc disappears in the Migration Period, but during the Viking Age torc-style metal necklaces, now mainly in silver, came back into fashion.  Torc styles of neck-ring are found as part of the jewellery styles of various other cultures and periods. Celtic warfare: This article discusses the warfare of the Ancient Celts throughout the European Iron Age and the Roman era, both of the Insular Celts and the Continental Celts (Gaul, Iberia, and Anatolia) Iron armour: Iron armour was a type of armour used on warships and, to a limited degree, fortifications.  The use of iron gave rise to the term ironclad as a reference to a ship 'clad' in iron.  The earliest material available in sufficient quantities for armouring ships was iron, wrought or cast.  While cast iron has never been used for naval armour, it did find a use in land fortifications, presumable due to the lower cost of the material.  One well known example of cast-iron armour for land use is the Gruson turret, first tested by the Prussian government in 1868.  Armoured ships may have been built as early as 1203, in the far east.  In the West, they first become common when France launched the first ocean-going ironclad \"La Gloire\" in 1859.  The British Navy responded with HMS \"Warrior\" in 1860, triggering a naval arms race with bigger, more heavily armed and armoured ironclads. Bronze- and Iron-Age Poland: The Bronze and Iron Age cultures in Poland are known mainly from archeological research.  Early Bronze Age cultures in Poland begun around 2300\u20132400 BCE, while the Iron Age commenced in approximately 700\u2013750 BCE.  The Iron Age archeological cultures no longer existed by the start of the Common Era.  The subject of the ethnicity and linguistic affiliation of the groups living in central and eastern Europe at that time is, given the absence of written records, speculative, and accordingly there is considerable disagreement.  In Poland the Lusatian culture, spanning both the Bronze and Iron Ages, became particularly prominent.  The most famous archeological finding from that period is the Biskupin fortified settlement (gord) on the lake from which it takes its name, representing the Lusatian culture of the early Iron Age."

The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) were the 2012 congressional elections. Willie Vaden: Willie Vaden (born April 7, 1948 in Grapeland, Texas) is a former mayor of Ingleside, Texas, and was the Republican nominee for the United States House of Representatives in Texas's 27th congressional district in 2004, 2006 and 2008.

In 2013, he announced that he was running in Florida 's 18 congressional district , in the 2014 elections.  In 2014, he finished in second place for the Republican nomination behind Carl J. Domino. Georgia's 1st congressional district: Georgia's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia.  The district is currently represented by Republican Buddy Carter, though the district's boundaries have been redrawn following the 2010 census, which granted an additional congressional seat to Georgia.

On the same day, she also lost in the general election for that seat in the 110th United States Congress.  Thereby she was in the interesting position of being a lame duck the moment she was elected.  In the 2008 campaign for the Republican nomination in the 22nd Congressional District, she finished first in the initial primary, but lost in a runoff to Pete Olson. Georgia's 3rd congressional district: Georgia's 3rd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia.

The district was one of the 12 original districts created prior to the 4th Congress.  It is currently represented by Republican Tom Marino, who defeated Democratic incumbent Chris Carney during the 2010 U.S. House elections.  In 2006, the 10th district experienced one of the greatest party shifts among all House seats that switched party control: in 2004, Republican Don Sherwood won with an 86% margin of victory over his nearest opponent and two years later, Carney unseated Sherwood by a 53%\u201347% margin.  In 2008, Carney won reelection by 12 points but the district swung back in 2010, electing Tom Marino.  The district is mostly Republican in its political composition, an aspect of the district that is reflected especially well in presidential elections.  In 2004, President George W. Bush won 60 percent of the vote in the district and in 2008, Senator John McCain beat Senator Barack Obama here by a margin of 54 percent to 45 percent.  Nonetheless, Carney easily won reelection as a Democrat the same year McCain won the district.  However, in the 2010 midterm elections, Marino unseated Carney by a 55%\u201345% margin.  In 2016, local business man and former mayor of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Mike Molesevich challenged Marino for the seat, but he fell to the Republican in November by more than two to one.  Marino remains the congressman in the 10th district, but he has expressed interest in a 2018 gubernatorial run rather than standing for reelection.

He served in the California State Assembly, representing the 4th District from 1996 to 2000, and the California State Senate, representing the 1st district from 2000 to 2004.  In 2004, Oller ran for Congress in California's 3rd congressional district, but narrowly lost the Republican primary to former California Attorney General Dan Lungren.  On January 10, 2008, Oller again ran for Congress, this time in California's 4th congressional district, for a seat being vacated by retiring Congressman John Doolittle.  He faced opposition from former Congressman Doug Ose.  On March 4, 2008, Oller dropped out of the race when California State Senator Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) announced that he was running for Doolittle's seat.  In a statement, Oller said his decision was \"a bitter pill indeed for me to swallow.\"  But, he said he was endorsing McClintock to prevent the election of Ose, whom he labeled as \"an unarguably liberal Republican.\"  Oller ran for the newly former 5th Assembly District in 2012 facing Madera County Supervisor Frank Bigelow in the November general election.  Oller lost to Bigelow by 5.7%."

Farmer solicited fictional-author stories from authors such as Arthur Jean Cox, Philip K. Dick, Leslie Fiedler, Ron Goulart, Howard Waldrop, and Gene Wolfe, urging them to submit their stories to venues such as \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\".  Only Cox, Waldrop, and Wolfe completed their stories and had them published, although Philip K. Dick's never realized fictional-author story \"A Man for No Countries\" as by Hawthorne Abendsen is said to have led Dick to write his posthumous novel \"Radio Free Albemuth\".  In the end, Farmer's fictional-author anthology never materialized. Traitor to the Living: Traitor to the Living (1973) is a science fiction novel by Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer.  The story follows Herald Childe, a private detective.  Childe is also the lead character in two prior Farmer novels published as pornography by Essex House.  In this non-erotic novel, the lead character is clearly Herald Childe, but it follows the events of a never-written third book which left Childe amnesiac. World of Tiers: The World of Tiers is a series of science fiction novels by American writer Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer.  They are set within a series of artificially-constructed universes, created and ruled by decadent beings who are genetically identical to humans, but regard themselves as superior, who are the inheritors of an advanced technology they no longer understand.  This technology enables the \"Lords\" (or 'Thoans' as described by Farmer in his introduction to a role-playing video game) to create novel lifeforms, and also to prevent aging or disease, making them effectively immortal.  Their technology also allows them to create small artificial universes (see pocket universe), and the planets and stars within them, and modify the physical laws (\"e.g.,\" changing the behavior of gravity) to create unusual or interesting phenomena within these universes.  Instantaneous travel within and between these universes is achieved by the use of \"gates\" which seem to function as teleportation devices, or as a means of creating wormholes between different regions of spacetime."

    "question": "What type of engine powered both the Saab 36 and the Avro Vulcan? Context: Avro Atlantic: The Avro Atlantic (Avro 722) was a proposed civilian airliner version of the British Avro Vulcan medium jet bomber.  It was a response to a 1952 UK Ministry of Supply requirement for a new aircraft suitable for both military and civilian long-range roles.  Civilian models of the Vickers Valiant and Handley Page Victor V-bombers were also planned for the same contract.  The Vickers V-1000 won the contest over the Atlantic, but ultimately none of these designs would be built. 1958 Syerston Avro Vulcan crash: The 1958 Syerston Avro Vulcan crash was a military aviation accident that occurred in England on 20 September 1958 during an air show at RAF Syerston, Nottinghamshire when a prototype Avro Vulcan bomber crashed.

Roy Chadwick: Roy Chadwick, CBE, FRSA, FRAeS (30 April 1893 \u2013 23 August 1947) was an aircraft design engineer for the Avro Company.  Born at Marsh Hall Farm, Farnworth, the son of the mechanical engineer Charles Chadwick, he was the chief designer for Avro and was responsible for practically all of their aeroplane designs.  He is famous in particular for designing the Avro Lancaster bomber, its follow-up Avro Lincoln and preliminary designs of the Avro Vulcan V bomber.  He also converted the Lincoln into the much-used Shackleton. Saab 36: The Saab 36 (also known as Projekt 1300) was a supersonic bomber planned by Saab during the 1950s.  The aircraft was intended to be able to carry an 800\u00a0kg free-falling nuclear weapon, but the Swedish nuclear weapons program was cancelled in the 1960s; the plans for the bomber had been cancelled in 1957.  The Saab 36 was to be fitted with delta wings, as was the Saab 35 Draken fighter.  The engine was to be a version of the British Bristol Olympus turbojet, the same engine powering the Avro Vulcan jet bomber. Avro: Avro was a British aircraft manufacturer founded in 1910 whose designs include the Avro 504 used as a trainer in the First World War, the Avro Lancaster, one of the pre-eminent bombers of the Second World War, and the delta wing Avro Vulcan, a stalwart of the Cold War.

Avro Vulcan: The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan from July 1963) is a jet-powered tailless delta wing high-altitude strategic bomber, which was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984.  Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46.  Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option.  Several scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and refine the delta wing design principles."

Latvian name: Latvian names, like in most European cultures, consist of two main elements: the given name (\"v\u0101rds\") followed by family name (\"uzv\u0101rds\").  During the Soviet occupation (1940 - 1991) the practice of giving a middle name was discouraged, but since the restoration of Independence Latvian legislation again allows giving of up to two given names and it has become more common to give a middle name to children. Middle name: In several cultures, people's names usually include one or more names in addition to the portion that is usually considered adequate to identify them.  In a number of cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, such a name is likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called a middle name.  In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names, occupying that position, even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a \"middle name\", and is actually (to mention several types of atypical cases): Barend: Barend or (somewhat dated spelling) Barent is a Dutch male given name and occasional middle name.  As of 2014, there are over than 4,000 men in the Netherlands with this as their first name, and nearly 3,000 with it as their middle name.  It was likely derived from Bernard.  Notable people with the name include: Singh: Singh is a title, middle name or surname, which originated in India.

Later in the series, it is revealed that Milhouse's middle name is \"Mussolini.\""

He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide.  His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k did in Finland and Bohemia, respectively.

Mount Grieg: Mount Grieg is a snow-covered mountain, rising to about 800 m , with a rock-exposed west face, overlooking the southeast part of Brahms Inlet and is situated on the base of the Derocher Peninsula, on the north side of the Beethoven Peninsula in the southwest part of Alexander Island, Antarctica.  A number of mountains in this vicinity first appear on maps by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE), 1947\u201348.  This mountain, apparently one of these, was mapped from RARE air photos by D. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960, and was remapped by the United States Geological Survey, 1988.  It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Edvard Grieg, the Norwegian composer. Grieg (crater): Grieg is a crater on Mercury.  It has a diameter of 65 kilometers.

However, as of mid-2016, due to mergers between several Norwegian institutions, the structure of Grieg Academy is changing and its remaining components are expected to be a doctoral research school (Grieg Research School in Interdisicplinary Music Studies) and various research groups.  Specifically, this is due to a merger between the University of Bergen\u2019s Faculty of Humanities with the Bergen Academy of Art and Design, as well as a nearly simultaneous merger between Bergen University College and two other university colleges in western Norway: Stord/Haugesund University College and Sogn og Fjordane University College to become, in January 2017, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HvL) The music programs across HvL will be the largest music department in western Norway in terms of the number of full time teachers."

    "question": "Tritonia and Phyteuma are both names for a what of plants? Context: Tritoniopsis: Tritoniopsis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae, first described as a genus in 1926.  The entire genus is endemic to Cape Province in South Africa.  The genus name refers to the African genus \"Tritonia\" and is combined with the Greek word \"opsis\", meaning \"look-alike\". Grex (horticulture): The term grex (pl.  greges or grexes; abbreviation gx), derived from the Latin noun \"grex, gregis\" meaning 'flock', has been coined to expand botanical nomenclature to describe hybrids of orchids, based solely on their parentage.  Grex names are one of the three categories of plant names governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants; within a grex the \"cultivar group\" category can be used to refer to plants by their shared characteristics (rather than by their parentage), and individual orchid plants can be selected (and propagated) and named as cultivars. Phyteuma: Phyteuma is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae, native to Europe and Morocco. Zygotritonia: Zygotritonia is a genus of herbaceous, perennial and bulbous plants in the Iris family (Iridaceae).  It contains four species distributed in Tropical Africa.  The genus name is derived from the word zygomorphic (meaning bilabiate), and the apparent resemblance to some species in the genus \"Tritonia\". List of plants by common name: This is a list of plants organized by their common names. However, the common names of plants often vary from region to region, which is why most plant encyclopedias refer to plants using their scientific names, in other words using binomials or \"Latin\" names. International Plant Names Index: The International Plant Names Index (IPNI) describes itself as \"a database of the names and associated basic bibliographical details of seed plants, ferns and lycophytes.\" Coverage of plant names is best at the rank of species and genus.  It includes basic bibliographical details, associated with the names, and its goals include eliminating the need for repeated reference to primary sources for basic bibliographic information about plant names. Botanical garden: A botanical garden or botanic garden is a garden dedicated to the collection, cultivation and display of a wide range of plants labelled with their botanical names.  It may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other succulent plants, herb gardens, plants from particular parts of the world, and so on; there may be greenhouses, shadehouses, again with special collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, or other exotic plants. Visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours, educational displays, art exhibitions, book rooms, open-air theatrical and musical performances, and other entertainment. Thonningia: Thonningia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Balanophoraceae containing the single species Thonningia sanguinea.  It is distributed throughout much of southern and western Africa, particularly the tropical regions.  Common names for the plant include ground pineapple.  A familiar plant to humans, it has an extremely long list of common names in many African languages.  Many names are inspired by the resemblance of the plant's inflorescence to a pineapple or palm tree.  Some of the names can be translated as pineapple of the bush (from Anyi), duiker's kolanut (from Igala), and crown of the ground (from Yoruba). Vascular plant: Vascular plants (from Latin \"vasculum\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \"trachea\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant.  They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis.  Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants).  Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta. Tritonia (plant): Tritonia (flame freesia) is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family first described as a genus in 1802.  They are naturally distributed across southern Africa, with a high concentration of species in Cape Province of western South Africa.  The genus is closely related to the genus \"Ixia\"."

    "question": "Which was secretary to President Richard Nixon: Rose Mary Woods or H. R. Haldeman? Context: Donald A. Nixon: Donald A. Nixon (born 1946) is a businessman.  He is the nephew of former President Richard Nixon and the son of Richard Nixon's brother, Donald Nixon and Clara Jane. Timeline of the presidency of Gerald Ford: The presidency of Gerald Ford began on August 9, 1974, when Gerald Ford became President of the United States, and ended on January 20, 1977, a span of days.  Ford, the 38th United States president, succeeded Richard Nixon, who had resigned from office.  Prior to this he was the 40th Vice President of the United States, serving from 1973 until President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974.  He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, following the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew on October 10, 1973.  Ford has the distinction of being the first, and to date the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office. Age of Secrets: Age of Secrets: The Conspiracy that Toppled Richard Nixon and the Hidden Death of Howard Hughes is a conspiracy theory-oriented biography of Howard Hughes personal advisor John H. Meier.  It is written by newspaper reporter Gerald Bellett and was published by the Las Vegas Free Press in 2015.  The book argues that Meier was one of the people who played a role in affecting President Richard Nixon's resignation in the wake of the Watergate scandal.  It also details how Meier was supposedly pursued for 20 years by the CIA, the Hughes organization, as well as Nixon sympathizers.  The book includes an excerpt from Meier's diary regarding what he says is his knowledge regarding the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. United States v. Nixon: United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision which resulted in a unanimous 8\u20130 ruling against President Richard Nixon, ordering him to deliver presidential tape recordings and other subpoenaed materials to the District Court.  Issued on July 24, 1974, the ruling was important to the late stages of the Watergate scandal, when there was an ongoing impeachment process against Richard Nixon.  \"United States v. Nixon\" is considered a crucial precedent limiting the power of any U.S. president to claim executive privilege. Hatchet man (politics): In the context of the Watergate scandal, the term hatchet man was used to refer to a trusted and particularly orthodox subordinate tasked by his employer with destroying a political opponent by any means necessary.  Charles Colson was known as a hatchet man for President Richard Nixon, as was H.R. Haldeman, who proudly described himself as \"Richard Nixon's 'son of a bitch'\".  This use of the term has since become commonplace for anyone who is tasked with conducting distasteful, illegal, or unfair \"dirty work\" to protect the reputation or power of their employer. Ronald H. Walker: Ronald H. Walker (born July 25, 1937) is an American executive.  Walker served in the administration of President Richard Nixon, first as the first Director of the White House Office of Presidential Advance, and later as Director of the National Park Service (1972\u20131975).

R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman became the operators of Nixon's presidential campaign, Woods was Nixon's gatekeeper. United States vice presidential selection, 1973: In 1973, Republican Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign following a controversy over his personal taxes.  Under the terms of the 25th Amendment, a vice presidential vacancy is filled when the president nominates a candidate who is confirmed by both houses of Congress.  Republican President Richard Nixon thus had the task of selecting a vice president who could receive the majority support of both houses of Congress.  Nixon considered selecting former Texas Governor John Connally, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and California Governor Ronald Reagan.  However, Nixon settled on House Minority Leader Gerald Ford of Michigan, who was popular among the members of Congress and who was good friends with Nixon.  Ford won the approval of both houses by huge margins, and was sworn in as the 40th Vice President of the United States on December 6, 1973.  In 1974, Ford ascended to the presidency after the Watergate scandal led to the resignation of President Nixon. Nixon v. General Services Administration: Nixon v. General Services Administration, 433 U.S 425 (1977), is a landmark court case concerning the principle of presidential privilege and whether the public is allowed to view a President\u2019s \u201cconfidential documents\u201d.  The Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1974, ordered that the Administrator of General Services obtain President Richard Nixon\u2019s presidential papers and tape recordings.  In addition, the Act further ordered that government archivists seize these materials.  These archivists would preserve the material deemed historic and return to former President Nixon the materials deemed as private.  Furthermore, this Act stated that material that was preserved could be used in judicial hearings and proceedings.  Immediately after this Act was enacted, Richard Nixon filed a lawsuit in a federal district court claiming that the Act violated the principle of separation of powers, the principle of presidential privilege, Nixon\u2019s personal privacy, his First Amendment right of association, and further asserted that it amounted to a constitutionally prohibited Bill of Attainder. Zilch memo: A memorandum known as the Zilch memo was an American government document sent by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to President Richard Nixon on January 3, 1972, about the military situation in Laos during the Vietnam War.  On the memo, in his own handwriting, Nixon described the decade-long bombing campaign by the United States in Southeast Asia as a \"failure,\" having achieved \"zilch,\" despite public comments to the contrary.  Just the day before, January 2, Nixon told CBS News reporter Dan Rather in an interview that the bombing was \"very, very effective.\"  Previously missing from the Richard Nixon Library, the memo was discovered in the possession of Alexander Butterfield, who served as the Deputy Assistant to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973, by \"Washington Post\" reporter Bob Woodward, who subsequently published it in his 2015 book \"The Last of the President's Men\"."

    "question": "Crash is similar to what 16th century British card game in the sense that there is no betting? Context: Crash (card game): Crash is a British card game extension of Nine-card Brag.  In Crash, there is no betting, as in Brag, but rather players aim to reach a total of 11 points, gained over successive deals. Triomphe: Triomphe (French for triumph) is a card game dating from the late 15th century.  It most likely originated in France or Spain (as triunfo) and later spread to the rest of Europe.  When the game arrived in Italy, it shared a similar name with the pre-existing game and deck known as \"trionfi\" (tarot).  While trionfi has a fifth suit that acts as permanent trumps, triomphe randomly selects one of the existing four suits as trumps.  Another common feature of this game is the robbing of the stock.  Triomphe became so popular that during the 16th century the earlier game of trionfi was gradually renamed tarocchi, tarot, or tarock.  This game is the origin of the English word \"trump\" and is the ancestor of many trick-taking games like Euchre (via \u00c9cart\u00e9) and Whist (via Ruff and Honours). Put (card game): Put is an English tavern trick-taking card game first recorded in the 16th century and later castigated by 17th century moralists as one of ill repute.  It belongs to a very ancient family of card games and clearly relates to a group known as Trut, \"Truque\", also \"Tru\", and the South American game Truco.  Its more elaborate version is the Spanish game of Truc, which is still much played in many parts of Southern France and Spain. Gleek (card game): Gleek is an English card game for three persons.  It is played with a 44-card pack and was popular from the 16th century through the 18th century. Tapp-Tarock: Tapp-Tarock (Viennese Tappen) is a three-player tarot card game which uses the 54-card Industrie und Gl\u00fcck deck.  This is an introductory game for more complex tarock games like Cego or K\u00f6nigrufen.  During the interwar period, it was the preferred card game of Viennese coffee houses.  Even today Tapp-Tarock is played sporadically.  The exact date when it appeared is not possible to identify, but it is likely to have been developed in Austria in the early 19th century.  The oldest version was narrated in 1821. Three card brag: Three-card brag is a 16th-century British card game, and the British national representative of the vying or \"bluffing\" family of gambling games.  Brag is a direct descendant of the Elizabethan game of Primero and one of the several ancestors to poker, just varying in betting style and hand rankings. Egyptian Ratscrew: Egyptian Ratscrew (also known as Egyptian Ratkiller, Egyptian War, and by other names) is a card game of the matching family of games.  The game is similar to the 19th century British card game Beggar-My-Neighbour, with the added concept of \"slapping\" cards when certain combinations are played, similar to and perhaps borrowed from Slapjack. Ombre: The historical importance of Ombre in the field of playing cards is the fact that it was the first card game in which a trump suit was established by bidding rather than by the random process of turning the first card of the stock.  This game developed from Triunfo, though it was from L'Hombre that the idea of bidding was adopted into other card games such as Skat, and Tarot, which owes Hombre a good portion of its betting system as well.  The game continued to be in vogue almost in every corner of Europe from the late 17th through the 18th centuries. Quadrille (card game): Quadrille is a card game that was popular in the 18th century.  A variant of the Spanish card game Ombre, it is played by four players in pairs, with a deck of 40 cards (the 8's, 9's and 10's being removed).  By the end of the 19th century, the card game had fallen out of fashion. \u00c9cart\u00e9: \u00c9cart\u00e9 is a two-player card game originating from France, the word literally meaning \"discarded\".  It is a trick-taking game, similar to whist, but with a special and eponymous discarding phase.  It is closely related to Euchre, a card game played mainly in the United States.  \u00c9cart\u00e9 was popular in the 19th century, but is now rarely played."

    "question": "What are both Camel Up and Outrage!? Context: Outrage factor: In public policy, outrage factor is public opposition to a policy that is not based on the knowledge of the technical details.  The term \"outrage factor\" originates from Peter Sandman's 1993 book, \"Responding to Community Outrage: Strategies for Effective Risk Communication\". Outrage Coda: Outrage Coda (\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8 \u6700\u7d42\u7ae0 ) is a 2017 Japanese yakuza film directed by Takeshi Kitano, starring Kitano (a.k.a. \"Beat Takeshi\"), and is scheduled for release in Japan on October 7, 2017.  It is a sequel to Kitano's 2012 film, \"Beyond Outrage\", and completes Kitano's Outrage trilogy started in 2010.  It received its premiere when it was screened out of competition at the 74th Venice International Film Festival. Camel: A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \"humps\" on its back.  The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (\"C. dromedarius\"), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (\"C. bactrianus\"), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (\"C. ferus\") that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia.  Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia (Yam & Khomeiri, 2015).  Additionally one other species of camel Cameline: Cameline ( ) was a fabric material used in the Middle Ages for cloth.  By tradition it is commonly thought to have been originally made of camel's hair in Asia.  It was imported from Cyprus and Syria into Europe.  Cameline is described also as a cloak of the Arabs made of camel's hair which is oftentimes striped white and brown in color.  Since history records it many times as a \"common and cheap\" textile it is thought that it was an imitation of the original Asian camel's hair fabric.  It was sometimes a lower quality French cloth imitation made of goat's hair.  The fibers were spun into yarn and produced in Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant in many colors in medieval times.  It is also described as a warm light woolen textile of camel's hair combined with wool or cotton.  It is considered of lesser quality than that of camlet, which is also made of camel's hair. Injaz: Injaz (Arabic: \u0625\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0632\u200e \u200e , meaning \"achievement\"; born April 8, 2009) is a female dromedary camel, credited with being the world's first cloned camel.  Dr. Nisar Ahmad Wani, a reproductive biologist and head of the research team at the Camel Reproduction Center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, announced on April 14, 2009, that the cloned camel was born after an \"uncomplicated\" gestation of 378 days.  The cloning project had the personal endorsement and financial support of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Prime Minister, Vice President of the United Arab Emirates, and the emir of Dubai.  Prior to this, there had been several unsuccessful attempts in the Emirate to clone a camel. Outrage porn: Outrage porn refers to any type of media that is designed to invoke outrage for the purpose getting traffic or attention online.  The term \"outrage porn\" was coined by political cartoonist and essayist Tim Kreider of The \"New York Times\".  Coined in 2009, the term was later popularized by author and \"Observer\" media critic Ryan Holiday. Egyptian Camel Transport Corps: The Egyptian Camel Transport Corps (known as the CTC, Camel Corps or Camel Transport) were a group of Egyptian camel drivers who supported the British Army in Egypt during the First World War's Sinai and Palestine Campaign.  The work done by the 170,000 men of the Corps helped British war operations in the Sinai desert and in Palestine and Syria by transporting supplies to the troops in extreme geographic and weather conditions. Wild Bactrian camel: The wild Bactrian camel (\"Camelus ferus\") is a critically endangered species of camel living in parts of northern China and southern Mongolia.  It is closely related to the domesticated Bactrian camel (\"Camelus bactrianus\").  They are both large, even-toed ungulates native to the steppes of central Asia, with a double hump (small and pyramid-shaped).  Until recently, wild Bactrian camels were considered to have descended from domesticated Bactrian camels that became feral after escaping from captivity or being returned to the wild.  However, a 1.9% difference in mitochondrial DNA suggests a divergence date of 0.7 to 1.5 million years ago, long before the start of domestication.  While previously considered to be a subspecies (\"Camelus bactrianus ferus\") of the Bactrian camel, the latest research establishes the wild Bactrian camel as a separate species from the domesticated Bactrian camel due to its distinct genetic makeup.  It is restricted in the wild to remote regions of the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts of Mongolia and Xinjiang. October Rage: October Rage formed in 2008 on the Central Coast of New South Wales Australia by brothers Nick and Will Roberts.

Following this taste of success recorded the band's debut album, \"Outrage\", released on iTunes September 2011.  \"Outrage\" lead to the \"Outrage tour\" of the U.S. 2012-13. Camel News Caravan: The Camel News Caravan or Camel Caravan of News was a 15-minute American television news program aired by NBC News from February 14, 1949 to October 26, 1956.  Sponsored by the Camel cigarette brand and anchored by John Cameron Swayze, it was the first NBC news program to use NBC filmed news stories rather than movie newsreels.  On February 16, 1954, the \"Camel News Caravan\" became the first news program broadcast in color, making use of 16mm color film.  In early 1955, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, maker of Camel cigarettes, cut back its sponsorship to three days a week.  Chrysler's Plymouth division sponsored the other days, and on those days, the program was labelled the \"Plymouth News Caravan\".  The program featured a young Washington correspondent named David Brinkley, and competed against \"Douglas Edwards with the News\" on rival CBS.  With greater resources, the \"News Caravan\" attracted a larger audience than its CBS competition until 1955."

News of the World (album): News of the World is the sixth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 28 October 1977 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States.  \"News of the World\" was the band's second album to be recorded at Sarm West and Wessex Studios, London, and engineered by Mike Stone, and was co-produced by the band and Stone.

    "question": "Luis Gianneo was teacher of which chief exponent of Argentine folk music? Context: Contemporary folk music: Contemporary folk music refers to a wide variety of genres that emerged in the mid 20th century and afterwards which were associated with traditional folk music.  Starting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music.  This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s.  The most common name for this new form of music is also \"folk music\", but is often called \"contemporary folk music\" or \"folk revival music\" to make the distinction.  The transition was somewhat centered in the US and is also called the American folk music revival.  Fusion genres such as folk rock, folktronica, and others also evolved within this phenomenon.  While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, it often shares the same English name, performers and venues as traditional folk music; even individual songs may be a blend of the two. Marta Lambertini: Marta Lambertini (born 13 November 1937) is an Argentine composer.  She was born in San Isidro, Buenos Aires, and studied at the Universidad Catolica Argentina with Roberto Caamano, Luis Gianneo and Gerardo Gandini, graduating in 1972.  She continued her studies in electroacoustic music in Buenos Aires, at the Centro de Investigationes de la Ciudad with Francisco Kr\u00f6pfl, Gerardo Gandini, Jos\u00e9 Maranzano and Gabriel Brncic. Folk music of England: The folk music of England is traditionally based music, which has existed since the later medieval period.  It is often contrasted with courtly, classical and later commercial music.  Folk music has been preserved and transmitted orally, through print and later through recordings.  The term is used to refer to English traditional music and music composed, or delivered, in a traditional style.  English folk music has produced or contributed to several important musical genres, including sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and dance music, such as that used for Morris dancing.  It can be seen as having distinct regional and local variations in content and style, particularly in areas more removed from the cultural and political centres of the English state, as in Northumbria, or the West Country.  Cultural interchange and processes of migration mean that English folk music, although in many ways distinctive, has particularly interacted with the music of Scotland.  It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and rock music, influencing musical styles and producing musical fusions, such as British folk rock, folk punk and folk metal.  There remains a flourishing sub-culture of English folk music, which continues to influence other genres and occasionally to gain mainstream attention. Swedish folk music: Swedish folk music is a genre of music based largely on folkloric collection work that began in the early 19th century in Sweden.  The primary instrument of Swedish folk music is the fiddle.  Another common instrument, unique to Swedish traditions, is the nyckelharpa.  Most Swedish instrumental folk music is dance music; the signature music and dance form within Swedish folk music is the polska.  Vocal and instrumental traditions in Sweden have tended to share tunes historically, though they have been performed separately.  Beginning with the folk music revival of the 1970s, vocalists and instrumentalists have also begun to perform together in folk music ensembles. Turkish folk music: Turkish folk music (\"T\u00fcrk Halk M\u00fczi\u011fi\") combines the distinct cultural values of all civilisations that have lived in Turkey and its former territories in Europe and Asia.  Its unique structure includes regional differences under one umbrella.  It was the most popular music genre in the Ottoman Empire era.  After the foundation of the Turkish Republic, Atat\u00fcrk asked to make a wide-scale classification and archiving of samples of Turkish folk music from around the country, which was launched in 1924 and continued until 1953 to collect around 10,000 folk songs.  In the 1960s, Turkish folk music met with radio and folk musicians like A\u015f\u0131k Veysel, Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f, Bedia Akart\u00fcrk became the most popular names of the Turkish folk music.  In the 1970s and 1980s, with the rising popularity of arabesque and Turkish light western, Turkish folk music has lost some ground, but singers like Belk\u0131s Akkale, \u0130zzet Alt\u0131nme\u015fe, Selda Ba\u011fcan, G\u00fcler Duman and Arif Sa\u011f made successful hit songs and became important representatives of the genre. Ariel Ram\u00edrez: Ariel Ram\u00edrez (4 September 1921 \u2013 18 February 2010) was an Argentine composer, pianist and music director.  He was considered \"a chief exponent of Argentine folk music\" and noted for his \"iconic\" musical compositions. Mercedes Sosa: Hayd\u00e9e Mercedes Sosa (] ; 9 July 1935 \u2013 4 October 2009), sometimes known as La Negra (literally: \"The Black One\"), was an Argentine singer who was popular throughout Latin America and many countries outside the region.  She was born on Argentina's Independence Day.  With her roots in Argentine folk music, Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of nueva canci\u00f3n.  She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters.  Her music made people hail her as the \"voice of the voiceless ones\", and \"the voice of America\". Luis Gianneo: Luis Gianneo (1897\u20131968) was an Argentine composer, pianist and conductor.  As music educator, he was the teacher of composers Ariel Ramirez, Juan Carlos Zorzi, Virt\u00fa Maragno, Pedro Ignacio Calder\u00f3n and Rodolfo Arizaga, among others. Carlos Guastavino: Carlos Guastavino (April 5, 1912 - October 29, 2000) was one of the foremost Argentine composers of the 20th century.  His production amounted to over 500 works, most of them songs for piano and voice, many still unpublished.  His style was quite conservative, always tonal and lusciously romantic.  His compositions were clearly influenced by Argentine folk music.  His reputation was based almost entirely on his songs, and Guastavino has sometimes been called \"the Schubert of the Pampas.\"  Some of his songs, for example \"Pueblito, mi pueblo\", \"La rosa y el sauce\" (\"The Rose and the Willow\") and \"\" (\"The Dove Was Wrong\"), became national favorites.  Unlike most other composers, at any time or place, Guastavino earned enough from his royalties and performing rights that he really had little need for other income. <ref name=\"BkltNI5818/20\">MacDonald, Callum.

    "question": "The composer for the music in the film \"A Clockwork Orange\" was born in which state? Context: Clockwork Orange (plot): Clockwork Orange is the name of the secret British security services project which was alleged to have involved a right-wing smear campaign against British politicians from 1974 to 1975.  The black propaganda led Prime Minister Harold Wilson to fear that the security services were preparing a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\".  The operation takes its name from \"A Clockwork Orange\", the 1971 Stanley Kubrick film. Michael Tarn: Michael Tarn (born 18 December 1953) is a British film and television actor.  He is best known for playing Pete in Stanley Kubrick's film \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971). Korova (record label): Korova is a record label, named after the fictitious Korova Milk Bar that was featured in the film \"A Clockwork Orange\", 'korova' also being the Russian word for 'cow'.  The imprint was founded in London, UK in 1979 as a division of Warner Music Group, with its first album release being Echo & The Bunnymen's debut \"Crocodiles\".  The label was active throughout the 1980s, not only releasing recordings by Echo & the Bunnymen, but also Airhead, The Sound, Guns for Hire, Dalek I Love You, Tenpole Tudor, Lori & The Chameleons, Ellery Bop and Strawberry Switchblade.  The label also put out a few UK releases from The Residents catalogue, as well as American artist Jeff Finlin's \"Angel in Disguise\", with the single \"American Dream #109.\" A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack): The soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange was released to accompany the 1971 film of the same name.  The music is a thematic extension of Alex's (and the viewer's) psychological conditioning.  The soundtrack of \"A Clockwork Orange\" comprises classical music and electronic synthetic music composed by Wendy Carlos (then Walter Carlos).  Some of the music is heard only as excerpts, e.g. Edward Elgar's \"Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1\" (a.k.a. \"Land of Hope and Glory\") ironically heralding a politician's appearance at the prison.  The main theme is an electronic transcription of Henry Purcell's \"Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary\", composed in 1695, for the procession of Queen Mary's cort\u00e8ge through London en route to Westminster Abbey.  \"March from 'A Clockwork Orange'\" (based on the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony by Beethoven) was the first recorded song featuring a vocoder for the singing; synthpop bands often cite it as their inspiration.  Neither the end credits nor the soundtrack album identify the orchestra playing the Ninth Symphony excerpts, however, in Alex's bedroom, there is a close-up of a microcassette tape labeled: \"Deutsche Grammophon \u2013 Ludwig van Beethoven \u2013 Symphonie Nr.  9 d-moll, op. 125 \u2013 Berliner Philharmoniker \u2013 Chor der St. Hedwigskathedrale \u2013 Ferenc Fricsay \u2013 Irmgard Seefried, Maureen Forrester, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Ernst Haefliger\". Alex (A Clockwork Orange): Alex is a fictional character in Anthony Burgess' novel \"A Clockwork Orange\" and Stanley Kubrick's film \"A Clockwork Orange\", in which he is played by Malcolm McDowell.  In the film, his surname is DeLarge, a reference to Alex calling himself Alexander the Large in the novel.  In the film, however, two newspaper articles print his name as \"Alex Burgess\".  In addition to the book and film, Alex was portrayed by Vanessa Claire Smith in the ARK Theatre Company's multi-media adaptation of \"A Clockwork Orange\", directed by Brad Mays. Korova (Liverpool): Korova is a bar, music venue and restaurant located on Hope Street, Liverpool, England.  Before moving to its current premises, it was located on Fleet Street close to Concert Square.  Its name references the Korova Milk Bar from \"A Clockwork Orange\". List of cultural references to A Clockwork Orange: Popular culture references to Anthony Burgess' novel \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1962) and Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film adaptation have been wide-ranging, from popular music and television to movies and other media.  Some references are based on themes central to the story, such as the use of Nadsat words or phrases, whilst others have incorporated visual elements from the film.  The film made Kubrick one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, and the film has become a cult classic. A Clockwork Orange (novel): A Clockwork Orange is a dystopian novel by Anthony Burgess published in 1962.  Set in a near future English society featuring a subculture of extreme youth violence, the teenage protagonist, Alex, narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him.

Animal Room: Animal Room is a 1995 American drama/thriller film directed, produced, and written by Craig Singer and starring Neil Patrick Harris as a bullied drug-using teenager and Matthew Lillard as the bully who loves to torment Harris's character.  The film is referred to as a modernized version of \"A Clockwork Orange\" and features an appearance from the punk rock band The Misfits (band). Stonedogs: Stonedogs is the first novel by New Zealand writer Craig Marriner.  It was published in 2001 and has won a Montana New Zealand Book Award.  The book has been described as \"a kind of \"A Clockwork Orange\"-meets-\"Once Were Warriors\" as imagined by Irvine Welsh\".

    "question": "Mazda's Mazda6 belongs to which country's car manufacturer? Context: Mazda 929: The Mazda 929 is a full-size car which was sold by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Mazda between 1973 and 1997.  Mazda utilized the 929 nameplate for export markets only, badge engineering its Luce model until 1991 and then transferring the name to export specification Sentia models.  Between 1982 and 1986, Mazda also used the 929 nameplate for its Cosmo coupe in certain export markets. Mazda RX-9: The Mazda RX-9 is a sports car produced by the Japanese automaker Mazda scheduled for release in 2020.  \"Holiday Auto\", a Japanese magazine, reported it will be previewed at the 2017 Tokyo Auto Show, and the final production model will be featured at the same event in 2019.  The car will be released in January 2020, to coincide with Mazda's 100th anniversary, and will be initially priced at eight million yen (US$(8000000/ 105.944781 )round0 in 2015).  It is believed it will showcase the return of the Wankel rotary engine, but CEO Masamichi Kogai said Mazda will not launch another rotary engine.  In the middle of the September 2017, Mazda has filed a patent application for an engine that uses two conventional turbochargers and an electric supercharger.  The engine looks compact, can replace the rotary engine and possibly be included in RX-9 production. Mazda Hakaze Concept: The Mazda Hakaze Concept is a concept car that was revealed in early February 2007 by Japanese manufacturer Mazda.  Its major design elements come from a new design language developed by Mazda called Nagare, developed by Laurens van den Acker, Mazda Global Design Director.  It translates to \"flow\".  This element has been used on past Mazda concept cars such as: Mazda Nagare; Mazda Ryuga; Mazda Kabura. Mazda Taiki: The Mazda Taiki is a one-off concept car produced by Mazda, and is the fourth car in Mazda's 'Nagare' design series.  Mazda says the Taiki \"reflects one possible direction for a future generation of Mazda sports cars aimed at helping to create a sustainable society\". Mazda Savanna: The Mazda Savanna is a rotary-powered automobile sold by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Mazda between 1971 and 1978.  Between 1978 and 1991, spanning two generations, Mazda sold the Savanna replacement as the Mazda Savanna RX-7.  Mazda only used the Savanna nameplate in Japan. Mazda GTP: The Mazda GTP is an IMSA GTP car that was built by Pierre Honegger in 1981.  Based on a Mazda RX-7, the car initially competed in the GTX category as the Mazda RX-7 GTP, before it was rebuilt for the IMSA GTP category in 1983.  Throughout its career, the car used a Mazda 13B Wankel rotary engine, similar to that used in the production RX-7s.  Although the rotary-engined sports prototypes generally had a reputation of being very reliable, the Mazda GTP frequently failed to finish races, and was never able to better the eighth place achieved at the 1983 24 Hours of Daytona.  In 1986, one car was purchased by Erie Scientific Racing, and rebuilt to become the Badger BB.  This car was no more successful or reliable than its predecessor, and was last used in 1989, by which point it was owned by Jack Engelhardt.  The other car, meanwhile, was rebuilt by Honegger into the Denali Speedcar, which was used with moderate success in 1986 and 1987. Bahman Group: Bahman Group (Persian: \u200e \u200e ) is an Iran-based manufacturer of vehicles under license by Mazda.  Bahman Group was founded in 1952 under the title of Iran Khalij Co by Mr. Amanollah Sarbaz and his son.

    "question": "What was the 2016 population of the city on the Bay Fundy which had an office of the Bank of British North America? Context: British America: English America (later British America) refers to the English territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783.  Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \"British America and the British West Indies\" until 1776, when the Thirteen Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America.  After that, the term British North America was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions.  That term was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. Bay of Fundy: The Bay of Fundy (French: \"Baie de Fundy\" ) is a bay on the Atlantic coast of North America, on the northeast end of the Gulf of Maine between the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, with a small portion touching the U.S. state of Maine. British North America: The term \"British North America\" refers to the former territories of the British Empire in mainland North America.  The term was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.  These territories today form modern-day Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Canada under British rule: Canada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.  Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom. Earl of Durham: Earl of Durham is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.  It was created in 1833 for the prominent Whig politician and colonial official John Lambton, 1st Baron Durham.  Known as \"Radical Jack\", he played a leading role in the passing of the Great Reform Act of 1832.  As Governor General of British North America he was the author of the famous \"Report on the Affairs of British North America\", known in Canada as the \"Durham Report\".  Lambton had already been created Baron Durham, of the City of Durham and of Lambton Castle in the County Palatine of Durham, in 1828, and was created Viscount Lambton at the same time as he was raised to the earldom.  These titles are also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Provinces and territories of Canada: The provinces and territories of Canada are the administrative divisions that are responsible for the delivery of sub-national governance within the geographical areas of Canada under the authority of the Canadian Constitution.  In the 1867 Canadian Confederation, three provinces of British North America\u2014New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, upon Confederation, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)\u2014were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century.  Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories.  The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan.  Several of the provinces were former British colonies, and Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew.  The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America.  Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area. Upper Canada Rebellion: The Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the oligarchic government of the British colony of Upper Canada (present day Ontario) in December 1837.  While public grievances had existed for years, it was the rebellion in Lower Canada (present day Quebec) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt soon after.  The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) - mainly through the support of the Hunters' Lodges, a secret anti-British, US-based militia that emerged around the Great Lakes.  They launched the Patriot War in 1838-39.  The rebellion led directly to Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America and to \"The British North America Act, 1840\" which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system. Rebellions of 1837\u20131838: The Rebellions of 1837\u20131838 (French: \"Les r\u00e9bellions de 1837\" ) were two armed uprisings that took place in Lower and Upper Canada in 1837 and 1838.  Both rebellions were motivated by frustrations with political reform.  A key shared goal was responsible government, which was eventually achieved in the incidents' aftermath.  The rebellions led directly to Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America and to The British North America Act, 1840 which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system and eventually led to the British North America Act, 1867 which created Canada and its government. British North America Acts: The British North America Acts 1867\u20131975 are the original names of a series of Acts at the core of the constitution of Canada.  They were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Canada.  In Canada, some of the Acts were amended or repealed by the Constitution Act, 1982.  The rest were renamed in Canada as the \"Constitution Acts\".  In the United Kingdom, those Acts that were passed by the British Parliament remain under their original names.  The term \"British North America\" (BNA) refers to the British colonies in North America. United Empire Loyalist: United Empire Loyalists (or just Loyalists) is an honorific given in 1799 by Lord Dorchester, the governor of Quebec and Governor-general of British North America, to American Loyalists who resettled in British North America during or after the American Revolution.  They settled in what was initially Quebec (including the Eastern Townships) and modern-day Ontario, where they received land grants of 200 acre per person, and in Nova Scotia (including present-day New Brunswick).  Their arrival marked the beginning of a predominantly English-speaking population in the future Canada west and east of the modern Quebec border."

She was launched on 4 August 1988 and completed on 14 December 1989.  \"Myosotis\" was stricken from the Belgian Naval Component in 2004 and sold to Bulgaria. Cemetery of the Evergreens: The Cemetery of the Evergreens is a non-denominational cemetery in Brooklyn and Queens, New York, colloquially called Evergreen Cemetery.  It was incorporated in 1849, not long after the passage of New York's Rural Cemetery Act spurred development of cemeteries outside Manhattan.  For a time, it was the busiest cemetery in New York City; in 1929 there were 4,673 interments.  The cemetery borders Brooklyn and Queens and covers 225 acre of rolling hills and gently sloping meadows.  It features several thousand trees and flowering shrubs in a park-like setting.  The Evergreens is the final resting place of more than 526,000 people. Myosotis decumbens: Myosotis decumbens is a plant species of the genus \"Myosotis\".

The Dickinson Homestead was the birthplace and home from 1855\u20131886 of 19th-century American poet Emily Dickinson (1830\u20131886), whose poems were discovered in her bedroom there after her death.  The house next door, called the Evergreens, was built by the poet's father, Edward Dickinson, in 1856 as a wedding present for her brother Austin.  Located in Amherst, Massachusetts, the houses are preserved as a single museum and are open to the public on guided tours.  The Emily Dickinson Home is a US National Historic Landmark, and properties contribute to the Dickinson Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ballota undulata: Ballota undulata, commonly known as common ballota or horehound, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to the Mediterranean region including Egypt, Israel and Jordan.

    "question": "What is the familiar name for the first operation in the Battle of Normandy, also codenamed Operation Overlord? Context: Normandy landings: The Normandy landings (codenamed Operation Neptune) were the landing operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (termed D-Day) of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II.  The largest seaborne invasion in history, the operation began the liberation of German-occupied northwestern Europe from Nazi control, and contributed to the Allied victory on the Western Front. Operation Charnwood: Operation Charnwood was an Anglo-Canadian offensive that took place from 8 to 9 July 1944, during the Battle for Caen, part of the larger Operation Overlord (code-name for the Battle of Normandy), in the Second World War.  The operation was intended to at least partially capture the German-occupied city of Caen (] ), which was an important objective for the Allies during the opening stages of Overlord.  It was also hoped that the attack would forestall the transfer of German armoured units from the Anglo-Canadian sector to the lightly screened American sector, where a major American offensive was being planned.  The British and Canadians advanced on a broad front and by the evening of the second day had taken Caen up to the Orne and Odon rivers. Mission Chicago: Mission Chicago was a pre-dawn glider-borne combat assault in the American airborne landings in Normandy, made by elements of the 101st Airborne Division on the early morning of June 6, 1944 during the Normandy landings of World War II.  It was part of Operation Neptune, the assault portion of the Allied invasion of Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord.  Originally slated to be the main assault for the 101st Airborne Division, the glider operation instead became the first reinforcement mission after the main parachute combat assault, Mission Albany.  Because the area of responsibility for the division was in close proximity to Utah Beach, the use of glider reinforcement was limited in scale, with most division support units transported by sea. Operation Perch: Operation Perch was a British offensive of the Second World War which took place from 7 to 14 June 1944, during the early stages of the Battle of Normandy.  The operation was intended to encircle and seize the German occupied city of Caen, which was a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division in the early phases of Operation Overlord.  Operation Perch was to begin immediately after the British beach landings with an advance to the south-east of Caen by XXX Corps.  Three days after the invasion the city was still in German hands and the operation was amended.  The operation was expanded to include I Corps for a pincer attack on Caen. Operation Dragoon: Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil) was the code name for the Allied invasion of Southern France on 15August 1944.  The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, but the lack of available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing.  By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces.  Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops.  As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August. Operation Overlord: Operation Overlord was the codename for the Battle of Normandy, the Allied operation that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II.  The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune, commonly known as D-Day).  A 1,200-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels.  Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June, and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August. American airborne landings in Normandy: The American airborne landings in Normandy were the first American combat operations during Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by the Western Allies on June 6, 1944, during World War II.  Around 13,100 American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions made night parachute drops early on D-Day, June 6, followed by 3,937 glider troops flown in by day.  As the opening maneuver of Operation Neptune (the assault operation for Overlord) the two American airborne divisions were delivered to the continent in two parachute and six glider missions. Mission Boston: Mission Boston was a parachute combat assault at night by Major General Matthew Ridgway's U.S. 82nd \"All American\" Airborne Division on June 6, 1944, part of the American airborne landings in Normandy during World War II.  Boston was a component element of Operation Neptune, the assault portion of the Allied invasion of Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord.  6,420 paratroopers jumped from nearly 370 C-47 Skytrain troop carrier aircraft into an intended objective area of roughly 10 sqmi located on either side of the Merderet river on the Cotentin Peninsula of France, five hours ahead of the D-Day landings. Operation Totalize: Operation Totalize (also spelled Operation Totalise in recent British sources) was an offensive launched by Allied troops in the First Canadian Army during the later stages of Operation Overlord, from 8 to 9 August 1944.  The intention was to break through the German defences south of Caen on the eastern flank of the Allied positions in Normandy and exploit success by driving south, to capture the high ground north of the city of Falaise.  The goal was to collapse the German front and cut off the retreat of German forces fighting the Allied armies further west.  The battle is considered the inaugural operation of the First Canadian Army, which had been activated on 23 July. Ray Barker: Ray Wehnes Barker (December 10, 1889 \u2013 June 28, 1974) was a Major General of the Allied Forces, and served in the European Theater of Operations During World War II.  General Barker was a key member of the combined United States-British group, which became known as COSSAC (Chief of Staff to Supreme Allied Commander).  This group planned the Battle of Normandy, codenamed \"Operation Overlord\", also known as D-Day, which liberated Occupied France.  He served as the Deputy Chief of Staff of the European Theater from 1943\u20131944, and Deputy Chief of Staff for Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force."

    "question": "Temagami-Lorrain Mine and Burwash Mine were both mines created during the early 1900s; which one yielded a 16-ton bulk sample of gold ore in 1935? Context: Lost Nigger Gold Mine: The Lost Nigger Gold Mine is a legendary mine in the folklore of the United States.  According to the legend, in 1887 four brothers in Dryden, Texas\u2014Frank, Jim, John, and Lee Reagan\u2014hired an illiterate Seminole man named William Kelly to help with work on their ranch.  Kelly was known as \"Nigger Bill\" (\"nigger\" being a term for a multiracial person in the slang of the Big Bend region) and has been identified as a cook and also as a horse wrangler; at the time of his employment by the Reagans, he was only 14.  While working on the ranch, Kelly announced that he had discovered a gold mine, and was \"greeted only with jeers\".  The next day he again tried to tell the Reagans about the mine, even going so far as to show them a lump of gold ore, but received a \"cussing out\" for his trouble. Barton Mine: Barton Mine, also known as Net Lake Mine, is an abandoned surface and underground mine in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.  It is located about 0.50 km north of the Temagami Arena in Temagami North and just east of the Ontario Northland Railway in northwestern Strathy Township.  Dating back to the early 1900s, it is one of the oldest mines in Temagami.  Barton was the site of a fire in the early 1900s, after which it never had active mining again. Burwash Mine: The Burwash Mine was a small gold property discovered in the fall of 1934 by Johnny Baker and Hugh Muir at Yellowknife Bay, Northwest Territories.  The town of Yellowknife did not exist yet at that point, but the discovery of gold at Burwash was the catalyst that brought more gold prospectors into the region in 1935 and 1936.  A short shaft was sunk in 1935-1936 at Burwash, and in the summer of 1935 a 16-ton bulk sample of ore was shipped to Trail, British Columbia for processing, yielding 200 troy ounces (6 kg) of gold.  The mine did not become a substantial producer and it is believed the gold vein was mined out. St. John's Mine: The St John's Mine is a mineral extraction site approximately three miles north of the city of Vallejo in Solano County, California, United States.  The St John's site was used for extraction of cinnabar in the early 1900s.  The St. John's Mine is classified as a medium priority mine from the standpoint of environmental oversight.  The last inspection of the Hastings Mine occurred in 1997 and found only slight erosion of the considerable mine tailings; however the tailings exceed 10000 cuyd of material, or one of the largest cinnabar tailings in the State of California.  Furthermore, the drainage from St. John's Mine flows to receiving waters of Rindler Creek and thence to Lake Chabot.  Miles of underground shafts were driven in the course of working the quicksilver deposits in the area.  In 1989, Earth Metrics reviewed old 1918 maps of workings of the Hastings and St. John's Mines and found that mine shafts were not driven into the site prior to the year 1918. Borden Lake mine: The Borden project located near Chapleau in Ontario, is approximately 160 kilometers west of Goldcorp's Porcupine mine.  The project has the potential to further enhance the long-term economics of Porcupine.  All material required permits, including the Advance Exploration permit, have been received to allow for the construction of a ramp into the deposit and the extraction of a 30,000 tonne bulk sample.  The ramp design for the purpose of the bulk sample is expected to be sufficient for ultimate mining purposes.  The underground platforms developed from the ramp access will further support exploration drilling of a deposit that remains open at depth and laterally.  A final feasibility study is expected to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2019 after the completion of a bulk sample.  With the expected ramp completion and minimal additional infrastructure required for full scale mining, the company expects to reach commercial production six months following bulk sample extraction. Golden Fleece Mine (Colorado): The Golden Fleece Mine is a gold mining site in Hinsdale County, Colorado, 5 mi south of Lake City.  The mine is located half a mile west of the north end of Lake San Cristobal.  By 1904 it had produced $1,400,000 in silver and gold ore.  The mine operated intermittently until 1919.  Later, in the mid-1960s, some renewed interest in the property came up, especially in the Hiwassee lode area of the mine, but other than a couple of small test shipments, there is no recorded production until today. Temagami-Lorrain Mine: Temagami-Lorrain Mine is an abandoned surface and underground mine in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.  It is located about 10 km northeast of the town of Temagami near Sauv\u00e9 Lake in central Cassels Township.  It is named after the Temagami-Lorrain Mining Company, which carried out work on the property in the early 1900s. Hutti Gold Mines Limited: Hutti Gold Mines Limited () (HGML) is a company located in the state of Karnataka, India and engaged in the mining and production of gold.  This was first established as Hyderabad Gold Mines in 1947.  With the closing of Kolar Gold Fields in 2001, this is the only company in India which produces gold by mining and processing the gold ore.  Owned by the Government of Karnataka, HGML has two plants located in Hutti and Chitradurga.  HGML mines gold from its main gold mine located in Hutti and other satellite mines. Malmberget mine: The Malmberget mine (Swedish: \"Malmbergsgruvan\") is one of the largest iron ore mines in Sweden.  The mine is located in Malmberget in Norrbotten County, Lapland.  The mine which is owned by Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) has an annual production capacity of over 5 million tonnes of iron ore.  The mine has reserves amounting to 350 million tonnes of ore grading 43.8% iron thus resulting 153.3 million tonnes of iron.  In 2009 the mine produced 4.3 million tonnes of iron.  It is one of the largest underground mines for iron ore in the world. Hidee Gold Mine: The Hidee Gold Mine is a former gold mine in Gilpin County, Colorado, United States.  It is one of the tourist attractions in and near the town as a result of the efforts of the local residents, and the Hidee Gold Mine company which worked to recreate the history of mining near Black Hawk, Colorado.  There are tours of the mine, which explain the methods that were used both in the past as well as the present.  Also during these tours, tourists are given a feel of being a miner, by including a stop at a gold ore vein where tourists use a single-jack (one-handed) hammer and chisel (provided) to chip a gold ore sample loose, which they are allowed to keep as a souvenir."

    "question": "Which of the people featured on Wall of Fame is the daughter of Bernie Ecclestone? Context: Brabham BT55: The Brabham BT55 was a Formula One racing car designed by Gordon Murray and David North for the Brabham team owned by Bernie Ecclestone.  It used a BMW four-cylinder turbocharged engine tilted over on its side to allow a clear supply of air to the rear wing.  The car competed during the 1986 Formula One season.  It was not successful and its introduction coincided with the end of Brabham's time as a competitive team.  Murray's next car (which he helped Steve Nichols design), McLaren's MP4/4, is usually claimed to be based on the same principles and won 15 of 16 races in 1988. Tamara Ecclestone: Tamara Ecclestone Rutland (born 28 June 1984) is a British model, socialite, television personality, and the daughter of billionaire Bernie Ecclestone. The Manor (Los Angeles): The Manor, also known as Spelling Manor, is a mansion located in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, across the street from Holmby Park.  Constructed in 1988 for television producer Aaron Spelling, it is the largest home in Los Angeles County.  It is currently owned by British heiress Petra Stunt, daughter of Formula One racing magnate Bernie Ecclestone.  Stunt purchased the home in 2011 for $85 million after it had been on the market for two years with an asking price of $150 million, making it the most expensive residential real estate listing in the US at the time. Slavica Ecclestone: Slavica Ecclestone (\"n\u00e9e\" Radi\u0107; born 2 June 1958) is the ex-wife of former Formula One CEO Bernie Ecclestone and a former model. Chase Carey: Chase Carey (born 1954) is a British-American executive.  He is the chief executive officer and executive chairman of the Formula One Group.  He has previously worked for News Corp, DIRECTV and 21st Century Fox.  He has been married for over 27 years and has a son and a daughter.  He is the new head of the Formula One Group, succeeding Bernie Ecclestone. Brabham BT46: The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One racing car designed by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season.  The car featured several radical design elements, one of which was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and oil radiators.  This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car\u2019s race debut, never to be seen again.  The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship. GP2 Series: The GP2 Series was a form of open wheel motor racing introduced in 2005 following the discontinuation of the long-term Formula One feeder series, Formula 3000.  The GP2 format was conceived by Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore, while Ecclestone also has the rights to the name GP1.  In 2010, the GP3 Series class was launched, as a feeder class for the GP2 series.  In 2017, the series was rebranded as the FIA Formula 2 Championship. Brabham BT43: The Brabham BT43 was the only Formula 5000 racing car built by Motor Racing Developments (MRD).  Initiated by Ron Tauranac, designed by Geoff Ferris, and built by a team including Nick Goozee (monocoque) and Bob Paton (construction), it was one of the last cars produced by MRD before MRD was closed by the then new Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone.  Based on the Formula Two Brabham BT40 (which was also designed by Geoff Ferris) the BT43 featured a modified monocoque that incorporated the triangular cross section pioneered by the Brabham BT42 Formula One car which was designed by Gordon Murray.  This distinctive pyramid shape not only kept the aerodynamic \"stagnation point\" low but also neatly allowed the incorporation of a \"crushable structure\" as required by the 1973 regulations which specified that all fuel tanks were to be protected by deformable structures.  Engine and gearbox were the then de facto F5000 standard combination of a Chevrolet 302 cubic inch engine in an unstressed mounting and a Hewland DG300 gearbox.  The fitment of these into what was a relatively small Formula Two sized car presented some design challenges.  Front suspension components were BT40 while rear suspension components were a combination of Formula One and BT40. Brabham BT50: The Brabham BT50 was a Formula One racing car designed by Gordon Murray and powered by a turbo BMW engine.  It was raced by the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, during the 1982 Formula One season.  Driven by Nelson Piquet and Riccardo Patrese, it made its debut at the South African Grand Prix before being withdrawn for further development of its engine while the team reverted to the previous year's car, the Brabham BT49.  On the reintroduction of the BT50, Piquet finished fifth in the Belgian Grand Prix.  A few races later he drove it to a win in the Canadian Grand Prix.  Later in the year it achieved three more finishes in the points for the team.  During the second half of the season, Brabham implemented the strategy of mid-race refueling.  This allowed Piquet and Patrese to start the races relatively light and use their reduced weight to gain track position over their competitors before stopping to refuel.  The poor reliability of the BT50 meant that they had only a few opportunities to demonstrate the strategy in practice. Formula One Constructors' Association: The Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA) was an organization of the chassis builders (constructors) who design and build the cars that race in the FIA Formula One World Championship.  It evolved from the earlier \"Formula 1 Constructors Association\" (F1CA; the name was changed due to unfortunate connotations in some languages) and came to be dominated by Bernie Ecclestone and Max Mosley (originally a co-founder of March Engineering).  Frank Williams, Colin Chapman, Teddy Mayer, Ken Tyrrell were also significant members.  FOCA served to represent the interests of their privately owned teams \u2013 usually against the race organisers and later against the manufacturer-owned or supported teams such as Ferrari, Matra and Alfa Romeo.  Ecclestone became the organisation's chief executive in 1978, with Mosley taking on the role of legal advisor."

Albert Kahn Associates: Albert Kahn Associates is an architectural design firm in Detroit, Michigan with a second office located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil.  It was established in 1895 and is still active today.  It introduced a new technology in industrial building involving a unique reinforced concrete method referred to as the Kahn System of construction using proprietary patented reinforcement steel manufactured by Trussed Concrete Steel Company.  The building of automobile factories and other types of factories were revolutionized from wooden timber framing construction.  Besides being an advanced technology in strength that led to wider open interior spaces, it featured a high degree of fire resistance and larger window space for light.  The firm started by Albert Kahn built factories for Chrysler for over a decade, Ford Automobile for 30 years and Packard Automobile for 35 years.  Other important clients of the firm were Republic Steel and General Motors.  The firm was awarded a $40 million dollar contract to build a tractor factory in Russia in 1928.  The firm's output was over a million dollars worth of work per week by 1929.  By 1939, the firm designed 19 percent of all industrial buildings in the United States and had designed some $800\u00a0million of buildings worldwide.

Sample, Howard Lash, head of the Carbon Steel Company, Millard Hunsiker, sales manager for the Carbon Steel Company, and Robert Scott, a mill superintendent for the Carnegie Steel Company, Hunt raised $20,000 to launch the Pittsburgh Reduction Company which was later renamed Aluminum Company of America and shortened to Alcoa. Geofeedia: Geofeedia is a social media intelligence platform that associates social media posts with geographic locations.  The company raised $3.5 million in their second round of venture capital in October 2014.  At the time, major clients included the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Dell.  Clients could visualize posts in an area in realtime and analyze the contents.  Services mined by Geofeedia include Instagram, Twitter, Periscope, Vine, YouTube, and Sina Weibo.  The company raised $17 million in Series B funding in early 2016 from Silversmith Capital Partners and reported 250% revenue growth in 2015 with clients including Mall of America and the NCAA.  At this time, 60 people worked for the company.  In October 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union published a report that the company's technologies were used to identify and arrest protestors in events such as the 2015 Baltimore protests that followed the death of Freddie Gray.

Trussed Concrete Steel Company: The Trussed Concrete Steel Company was a company founded by Julius Kahn, an engineer and inventor.  The company manufactured prefabricated products for reinforced concrete beams and steel forms for building reinforced concrete floors and walls.  Kahn invented and patented a unique new technology reinforcement system of construction called the Kahn System that was stronger, more economical, and lighter than the existing old school technology used up to that point to construct buildings.  The old method was to use plain straight smooth steel beams or loose rods or stirrups in concrete beams and floors.  Kahn's new technology improved system used 45 degree tab flanges or \"wings\" permanently attached on steel beams that distributed the tension stress for overall improvement in strength of reinforced concrete. William Walker Scranton: William Walker Scranton (April 4, 1844 \u2013 December 3, 1916) was an American businessman based in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  He became president and manager of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company after his father's death in 1872.  The company had been founded by his father's cousin George W. Scranton.  Among his innovations, Scranton adopted the Bessemer process for his operations in 1876, greatly increasing production of steel ties with a new mill.  Scranton founded the Scranton Steel Company, in 1891 consolidated as Lackawanna Iron and Steel Company.  The steel company became the second largest in the nation.  He later also managed the Scranton Gas and Water Company, developing a secure water supply outside the city by creating Lake Scranton."
