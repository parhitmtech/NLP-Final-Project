The Esterh\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdzys curtailed their musical activities in 1790, but by that time Haydn was known all over Europe and widely considered the greatest living composer. (He himself deferred to Mozart in that regard, and the friendly competition between the two composers deepened the music of both.) Two trips to London during the 1790s resulted in two sets of six symphonies each (among them the \"Surprise\" symphony) that remain centerpieces of the orchestral repertoire. Haydn's final masterpieces included powerful choral works: the Creation and Seasons oratorios and a group of six masses. Haydn stopped composing in 1803, after which he prefaced his correspondence with a little musical quotation (from one of his part-songs) bearing the text \"Gone is all my strength; I am old and weak.\" He died in Vienna on May 31, 1809.

In 930 A.D., the ruling chiefs established a republican constitution and an assembly called the Althingi--the oldest parliament in the world. Iceland remained independent until 1262, when Iceland entered into a treaty which established a union with the Norwegian monarchy. It passed to Denmark in the late 14th century when Norway and Denmark were united under the Danish crown. [PAR] In the early 19th century, national consciousness revived in Iceland. The Althingi had been abolished in 1800 but was reestablished in 1843 as a consultative assembly. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland home rule in 1874, which again was extended in 1904. The constitution, written in 1874, was revised in 1903, and a minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjavik, was made responsible to the Althingi. The Act of Union, a 1918 agreement with Denmark, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state united with Denmark under a common king.

Because it varies in magnitude, Betelgeuse occasionally surpasses Procyon in Canis Minor in brightness and becomes the seventh brightest star in the sky. When at its brightest, Betelgeuse outshines Rigel, the brightest star in Orion , and becomes the sixth brightest star in the sky. At its faintest, it drops below Deneb , the brightest star in Cygnus , and shares the position of the 20th brightest star with Mimosa, Beta Crucis, located in Crux constellation and one of the stars that form the Southern Cross . [PAR] Betelgeuse is a pulsating red supergiant showing low-amplitude variations and periods of stable brightness. The star\u2019s pulsations result in its absolute magnitude varying from -5.27 to -6.27. As its outer layers expand and contract, the surface increases and decreases, and the temperatures rises and falls. Betelgeuse pulsates because it has an unstable stellar atmosphere. When it contracts, it absorbs more of the energy that passes through it. As a result, its atmosphere heats up and expands. When the star expands, the atmosphere becomes less dense and cools down, which leads to another period of contraction. [PAR] This collage "

Once he comes in contact with the Jewish people, he begins to suspect that he is indeed one of them. [PAR] Though the title of the story would give the impression that the tale's focus is its eponymous hero, Daniel Deronda, the reader is taken by surprise to find that Gwendolen Harleth shares the limelight in equal measure. She is one of the least lovable of heroines in literature, yet her shallow snobbery, wit, the depth of her despair and her overwhelming narcissism (in one scene we find her kissing her own image in the mirror!) make her an unforgettable character. For her, marriage is a ticket to the higher echelons of society. Caught in an abusive marriage which she entered into for her own ends, she begins to depend on Daniel Deronda whose generous nature makes him ever willing to extend a helping hand.

Context: Hoffmann himself found tremendous inspiration in the works of Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), so much so that he changed his own middle name to Amadeus. Years after Hoffmann's death, his life as a teller of tales fueled the musical imagination of French composer Jacques Offenbach (1819-1880). Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoff-mann spins a fantasy around the writer and a number of his works. [PAR] One of Hoffmann's stories, \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\" (1819), intrigued French writer Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870). Dumas published a translated and freely adapted version of this story in French. Dumas's \"The Story of a Nutcracker\" (1844) charmed the director of Russia's Imperial Ballet, who decided to commission a work based on the story. He hired the French choreographer Marius Petipa and his Russian colleague Lev Ivanov to choreograph the dancing. Petipa and Ivanov outlined the stage action needed to tell the story. Then they handed over a specific set of instructions to the composer who had been commissioned to write the music for the ballet. Luckily for future ballet lovers they selected Pyotr Tchaikovsky, who at that time was already considered a rising star among Russia's composers. Hoffmann's complicated and somewhat frightening tale can hardly be recognized in today's productions of The Nutcracker. Petipa and Ivanov presented The Nutcracker as a delightful children's fantasy.

Approximately 50,000 miles (80,000 km) of roads spanned the Roman Empire, spreading its legions, culture and immense influence throughout the known world. The old saying \"all roads lead to Rome\", simply couldn't have been truer. Rome was the hub of commerce, trade, politics, culture and military might in the Mediterranean, and the grand achievement of her road network all led directly to the city and back out to her many territories.

Starting with local roads, Rome was connected first to Latium, Ostia and surrounding areas. By the mid 4th century BC, as they pushed south into Samnite territories and Campania, longer highways were developed to give the legion an advantage over Rome's adversaries. The Via Appia, built between was the first, and most famous, of these.

It could be argued that since Blue Ice wasn't based on a Len Deighton novel that it's not Palmer but then none of the following Palmer movies were based on Deightons novels either. [PAR] Michael Caine returns as a secret agent in Kingsman: The Secret Service. This time as \"Arthur\" (after all Harry wasn't his real name) the bespectacled head of a secret espionage unit.

Pliny said that Topazos is a legendary island in the Red Sea and the mineral \"topaz\" was first mined there. Alternatively, the word topaz may be related to the Sanskrit word \u0924\u092a\u0938\u094d \"tapas\", meaning \"heat\" or \"fire\". [PAR] Historical usage [PAR] Nicols, the author of one of the first systematic treatises on minerals and gemstones, dedicated two chapters to the topic in 1652.  In the Middle Ages, the name topaz was used to refer to any yellow gemstone, but in modern times it denotes only the silicate described above. [PAR] Many modern English translations of the Bible, including the King James Version mention topaz.  However, because these translations as topaz all derive from the Septuagint translation topazi[os], which as mentioned above referred to a yellow stone that was not topaz, but probably chrysolite (chrysoberyl or peridot), it should be borne in mind that topaz is likely not meant here.

Suppose current I1 and current I2 are flowing through the paths ABC and ADC respectively. If we vary the electrical resistance value of arm CD the value of current I2 will also be varied as the voltage across A and C is fixed. If we continue to adjust the variable resistance one situation may comes when voltage drop across the resistor S that is I2.S is becomes exactly equal to voltage drop across resistor Q that is I1.Q. Thus the potential at point B becomes equal to the potential at point D hence potential difference between these two points is zero hence current through galvanometer is nil. Then the deflection in the galvanometer is nil when the switch S2 is closed.  Now, from Wheatstone bridge circuit [PAR] and [PAR] Now potential of point B in respect of point C is nothing but the voltage drop across the resistor Q and this is [PAR] Again potential of point D in respect of point C is nothing but the voltage drop across the resistor S and this is [PAR] Equating, equations (i) and (ii) we get, [PAR] Here in the above equation, the value of S and P \u2044 Q are known, so value of R can easily be determined.

[PAR] My experience with Boyle\u2019s work has been relatively limited (so far). That said, one thing that his works seem to me to have in common is a great deal of energy. Those films of his that I have seen are kinetic, dynamic, and leap from the screen. Even when they are not all that I might want them to be, Boyle\u2019s movies keep me invested with their combination of intensity and vigorous storytelling. All of this is true for Trainspotting, a film that managed to hold my attention tightly for its entire duration despite the fact that it will probably never join the ranks of my personal favorites. [PAR] By the very nature of its subject matter\u2014namely, the lives and the relationships between a number of addicts\u2014one would expect parts of Trainspotting to be unpleasant, but Boyle does not simply decorate his film with moments of grim reality. Instead, he allows grim reality to dominate every scene. While he does not wholly condemn his characters, Boyle doesn\u2019t turn a blind eye to the consequences of their behavior either. Rather, he successfully manages to portray multiple horrors of crime and drug use without ever allowing his film to become melodramatic. Trainspotting may be frustrated and disillusioned, but it does not pair those feelings with moralization. For all their many faults, Trainspotting respects its characters enough not to sugarcoat their lives or to use them to make sweeping generalizations. "

The construction of the monument was initiated by Perikles, the supervisor of the whole work was Pheidias, the famous Athenian sculptor, while Iktinos (or Ictinus) and Kallikrates (Callicrates) were the architects of the building. The temple is built in the Doric order and almost exclusively of Pentelic marble. It is peripteral, with eight columns on each of the narrow sides and seventeen columns on each of the long ones.

    "question": "Which fruit is known in Portuguese as a marmelo, the first marmalades being made from this fruit? Context: [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The etymology and history of \u2018mermelada\u2019 [PAR] Until around 1850, the word mermelada applied in Spain exclusively to a quince preserve made with honey or sugar: the term in fact derives from membrillo, the Spanish word for quince. The Greeks called the quince kydonion or m\u00ealon kydonion because of its resemblance to an apple (m\u00ealon), from which the Romans\u2019 name for the quince - malum cotoneum or malum cydonium \u2013 is clearly derived. [PAR] Except for a very few varieties of it, the quince is a rough and very acidic fruit when raw which is why, in Ancient Greece (1100-146BC), it was frequently preserved and eaten steeped or cooked in honey (as Apicius tells us). Two thousand years ago, Hispania was the leading exporter of quince in the Roman Empire, so that the Iberian Peninsula was no stranger to this method of preserving back in Antiquity . [PAR] Given the tartness of its flavor, it is hard to believe that the quince was known as \u2018sweet apple\u2019 (melimelum), as 1.Corominas (1905-1997) Spanish philologist, professor at the University of Chicago until 1967, informs us it was. That name seems more likely to have referred to the preserved version, known in Latin as malum mellatum (quince in honey), a name that could easily evolve into malimellum or melimellum. "

Context: Joan's increasing avarice, in fact, makes her a less attractive heroine as the novel goes on, though Peters manages to keep the reader from losing all sympathy for her. [PAR] There are some nice moments in this novel, such as the scene where Joan encounters an old admirer and finds, to her chagrin, that he no longer carries a torch for her. All in all, it's a quick and enjoyable read. [PAR] Having finished the novel, I was interested in learning more about the historical Joan of Navarre, who was indeed accused by Henry V of witchcraft in 1419. Henry V never proved the charges, and most historians, including Henry V's biographer Christopher Allmand, believe that they were a pretext for the cash-strapped Henry to seize Joan's revenues. (Tensions between England and Brittany, where Joan's son from her first marriage ruled, probably didn't help either.) [PAR] Peters portrays Joan's imprisonment as being a spartan one, but this was hardly the case. A.R. Myers in his article \"The Captivity of a Royal Witch\" notes that Joan was provided with a large household, rich clothing, and varied foods and wines. She received illustrious visitors, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Winchester, and her stepson the Duke of Gloucester.

    "question": "Coxa is the medical name for which joint of the human body? Context: A hyaline cartilage ring called the labrum surrounds the glenoid cavity to provide a flexible reinforcement to the joint, while muscles of the rotator cuff hold the humerus in place within the cavity. [PAR] The hip joint is somewhat less mobile than the shoulder, but is an overall stronger and more stable joint. The added stability of the hip joint is necessary to bear the weight of the body resting on the legs while performing actions such as standing, walking, and running. In the hip joint the rounded, almost spherical head of the femur (thigh bone) fits tightly into the acetabulum, a deep socket in the os coxa (hip bone). Many tough ligaments and the powerful hip muscles hold the head of the femur in place and resist some of the most powerful strains in the body. The depth of the acetabulum also prevents dislocations of the hip by limiting the movement of the femur within its socket. [PAR] Ball-and-socket joints are classified functionally as multiaxial joints because they can move bones along several axes. The muscles that surround the joints permit the humerus and femur to move away from the body\u2019s midline (abduction), toward the body\u2019s midline (adduction), forward (flexion), and backwards (extension). The humerus and femur can also move around the joint in a full circle (circumduction) as well as rotate both medially and laterally around their axis. "

Fish and Wildlife Service [PAR] If you're on safari in Africa and spot a tiger, it's definitely something to write home about. Tigers as we know them, you see, have never lived in the wild in Africa. But there's still a chance you could see one there. Let us explain. [PAR] Lions, leopards and tigers are all part of the Felidae family of cats, which originated in Africa and share a common ancestor. At some point, probably around 2 million years ago, one offshoot of Felidae migrated east toward Asia, and those cats evolved into the orange-, black-, and white-striped beasts we know today. Once established in Asia, however, tigers never returned to Africa, although scientists aren't exactly sure why. [PAR] \"One can offer a series of speculations about why tigers did not get to Africa, but they are all speculations,\" said J.L. David Smith, professor at the University of Minnesota's department of fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology. \"The best explication is time.\" [PAR] Many wildlife researchers believe that, historically, tigers inhabited much of Asia, and that various tiger subspecies naturally migrated and spread out over time. Pleistocene glacial fluctuations and geographic boundaries, however, probably made it too difficult for tigers to return to Africa.

Context: The auricle is hollow and extends outward from the anterior surface to increase the internal volume of the right atrium. [PAR] Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through three major veins: the superior and inferior vena cava and the coronary sinus. The superior vena cava returns all of the blood to the heart from tissues superior to the heart in the head, neck, arms and upper thorax. Likewise, the inferior vena cava returns blood to the heart from tissues inferior to the heart, including the legs, abdomen and lower thorax. Blood from the exterior of the heart itself is collected in the coronary sinus to be returned to the interior of the heart. [PAR] On the medial edge of the right atrium is a muscular wall known as the interatrial septum. The interatrial septum separates the left and right atria and prevents blood from passing between them. As an infant, a small hole in the interatrial septum known as the foramen ovale allows blood flow from the right atrium to the left atrium to reduce the flow of blood to the inactive lungs. At birth, a small flap of tissue moves to cover the foramen ovale and prevent the flow of blood between the atria. As an adult, a small indentation in the interatrial septum known as the fossa ovalis remains where foramen ovale once existed. In some cases the foramen ovale fails to close in a condition known as patent foramen ovale. [PAR] The right atrium also contains the sinoatrial (SA) node, the pacemaker of the heart. "

With national union achieved, a balance between liberty and order secured, a trifling national debt, and a virgin continent awaiting the plow, there opened a serene prospect of peace, prosperity, and social progress. [PAR] Politically this was an \"era of good feeling,\" as contemporaries called it, and a spirit of unity pervaded the reconstruction measures which followed the peace. Commerce was cementing the American people into a national entity. The privations of the war period had shown the importance of protecting the manufactures of America until they could stand alone against foreign competition. Economic independence, it was urged, was as essential as political; indeed, political independence was hardly a reality without economic self-sufficiency and, as the Revolutionary War had been fought for the one, so now it was proposed to win the other. Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, Congressional leaders at the time, believed in \"protection\"- that is, the passage of a tariff which permitted the development of American industry.

While many auction houses exist, only a few have the expertise and resources necessary to properly deal in watches and clocks. Over the last few years watch auctions have become so increasingly popular that the best auction houses have opened up dedicated \"watch departments.\" Working with one of these houses will increase your chances to find the right buyer for your highly collectible watch, or perhaps help you find that special vintage piece you've been searching for.

Note that the trade-off as opposed to more self-service options such as eBay is price. Auctioneers are known for steep fees and commissions on both the buyer's and seller's end. Having said that, if you are a seller for instance, a good auction house is your best bet in most instances for finding the most well-funded collector's. Often the trade-off is worth it.

The Screwdriver sits alongside the better-known Bloody Mary, Moscow Mule and Vodka Martini as one of four classic cocktails that pushed Smirnoff No. 21, and the previously unknown category of vodka, to dominate the global drinking scene.  Before World War II, fresh orange juice was only available in season, while canned juices tasted very different from the real thing. The Screwdriver benefited from new, better-tasting packaged orange juice that arrived in the late 1940s. The name, a carefully masculine title for what could otherwise have been perceived as a feminine drink, supposedly derives from wildcatters drilling exploration oil wells in (variously) California, Texas, Persia or Saudi Arabia. Feeling parched in the desert, the oilmen would stir vodka into their orange juice using the only available tool \u2013 a screwdriver. The Screwdriver travelled fast. Creatively promoted in Los Angeles, by 1949 it was on the menus in bars as far afield as Turkey; by the 1960s it was a standard bar call. The key to this classic combination is good quality orange juice, ideally freshly squeezed, which allows the clean taste of Smirnoff No. "

The hormones produced by each gland complete the loops by travelling in the bloodstream between them.

    "question": "What does someone need to wear if they are myopic? Context: People with vision scores of 20/200 or worse are considered legally blind . [PAR] There are many different medical reasons people wear glasses, but the simple answer is that glasses help people see better. Some people wear glasses for reading things that are far away or for driving. [PAR] Other people only wear glasses when they're doing an up-close activity, like reading, writing, or knitting . Some people wear glasses all the time. [PAR] People who have difficulty seeing objects that are far away are called \u201c myopic \" or \u201c nearsighted .\" This means they can easily see objects that are close to them, but when viewing objects in the distance, the image can appear fuzzy . Nearsightedness occurs when the physical length of the eye is longer than the optical length, meaning the visual image is focused in front of the retina , rather than directly on it. [PAR] People who have difficulty reading and seeing things close-up are called \u201c hyperopic \" or \u201cfar-sighted.\" Farsightedness occurs when the visual image is focused behind the retina , and may be caused by weak focusing power or the eyeball being too small. [PAR] Another condition that can cause people to need glasses is \" astigmatism ,\" which occurs when part of the eye is irregularly shaped. [PAR] Thankfully, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism can usually be corrected by wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses . Both eyeglasses and contact lenses use convex or concave lenses to bend the light entering the eye . This refocuses the eye , helping to correct vision problems. "

Context: [PAR] The Enigma code was the backbone of German military and intelligence communications. It had originally been developed in 1918 for use in banking, but the German military saw its potential for military use and adapted it. [PAR] The machine that produced the code was a system of rotors, keyboards, and electrical wires resembling a typewriter, according to the National Archives. The machine was portable and ideally suited for use in combat, and was quickly adopted by all branches of the German armed forces, the National Archives said. [PAR] The Germans thought it was unbreakable, but the code had its flaws. One fundamental flaw was that no letter could ever be encrypted as itself. Another was the errors in messages sent by tired, lazy, or stressed German operators, and yet another was the German habit of using standard phrases at the start of each message, allowing cryptanalysts to establish educated guesses. [PAR] Turing and fellow Cambridge mathematician Gordon Welchman worked at Bletchley to improve a Polish machine that had been built before the war to crack earlier versions of Enigma. The pair's new Bombe was perfected in 1940 and they began deciphering Luftwaffe communications.

This does not mean it is necessary to speak or read fluent Hebrew.  However, you will be working extensively with the letters of the alphabet (or Aleph-Beth), and certain words and phrases in Hebrew will become as familiar to you as any word in your native tongue. [PAR] If the student questions why we should bother with Hebrew as a \"sacred language\", it is my hope to fully answer the question in this lesson.  As we shall see, the Hebrew alphabet was the first true alphabet among humankind.  Each letter encompasses hieroglyphic, phonetic, and numerical values. [PAR] Hebrew also enjoyed the honored status of \"dead language\" for thousands of years- including the time during which the Western Hermetic traditions were born.  This, combined with the fact that the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, made the Semitic language the choice par excellence for Medieval and Renaissance mysticism.  (Both Judaic and Christian.)  Once established as a sacred language, the letters earned even further correspondences and interpretations- many of which we will cover below. "

Context: [PAR] The Stradivari family moved to a new house at No. 2, Piazza San Domenico in 1680, and the building would serve as the violin maker's home and workshop for the rest of his life. Here he matured in his art and created his greatest works, most notably the violins that set the standard for perfection in the music world. In the 1680s, he continued to develop his own style, deviating from Amati's design to create a more solid-looking violin that used new materials and finishes. The resulting instruments during this time created a more powerful sound than earlier violins, and musicians from outside Cremona began to seek out instruments from his workshop as his fame grew. Upon Amati's death in 1684, Stradivari was considered the city's greatest violin maker. [PAR] Despite his considerable success with his designs, Stradivari continued to look for ways to improve his violins. In the 1690s, he experimented with the length of the instrument, creating what was known as the \"long pattern\" or \"long Strad\"\u2014a violin that was 5/16 of an inch longer than the traditional pattern. The result was a deeper, fuller tone that was quite distinct from the lighter sounds of other Cremona instrument makers. Stradivari's wife died in 1698, and she was honored with a large funeral. In the summer of the following year, the craftsman married his second wife, Antonia-Maria Zambelli. He had five more children from this marriage"

Context: A fierce rain of arrows halted the center of the       Athenian line, but the reinforced wings were able to close with the enemy       and engage in close-quarters combat.

    "question": "In a petrol engine what component mixes fuel and air? Context: [DOC] [TLE] Petrol engineA petrol engine (known as a gasoline engine in American English) is an internal combustion engine with spark-ignition, designed to run on petrol (gasoline) and similar volatile fuels. The first practical petrol engine was built in 1876 in Germany by Nikolaus August Otto, although there had been earlier attempts by \u00c9tienne Lenoir, Siegfried Marcus, Julius Hock and George Brayton.  The first petrol combustion engine (one cylinder, 121.6 cm3 displacement) was prototyped in 1882 in Italy by Enrico Bernardi. In most petrol engines, the fuel and air are usually pre-mixed before compression (although some modern petrol engines now use cylinder-direct petrol injection). The pre-mixing was formerly done in a carburetor, but now it is done by electronically controlled fuel injection, except in small engines where the cost/complication of electronics does not justify the added engine efficiency. The process differs from a diesel engine in the method of mixing the fuel and air, and in using spark plugs to initiate the combustion process.  In a diesel engine, only air is compressed (and therefore heated), and the fuel is injected into very hot air at the end of the compression stroke, and self-ignites.

The fact that the repeated line is spoken by Mercutio is absolutely critical to the story as well in that Mercutio is connected to both families either as a relation or a freind.\u00a0 Hence, only Mercutio serves as the social bridge between the two families and now both families have killed that one social bridge. [PAR] The word \"plague\" can refer to any highly infectious disease that causes many deaths through an epidemic. It can also refer to any \"evil\" that one can use to hurt another person with, therefore, we can think of a plague as a curse (Random House Dictionary). Hence, one thing that Mercutio means when he says, \"A plague o' both your houses,\" is that he is cursing their families. We see this curse come true when both Romeo and Juliet later die in the story. As Prince Escalus later points out, God has punished Lords Capulet and Montague for their hatred by taking away what they both loved (V.iii.303-304). [PAR] Since a plague is an infectious disease that causes many deaths, we can also say that through this line Mercutio is pointing out what he already sees as true, that both houses are already cursed due to their hatred and prolonged feud.

This is to deal with the extreme variation of temperature in the Gobi desert where summer highs often top 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and winter months can see significant amounts of snow.  In general, Bactrian camels are much more mild-mannered than their hot-tempered dromedary kin.  (The Dromedary camel has a uniform length of hair year round.)

It is located near the southwest corner of Jordan just east of the Israeli border.

    "question": "\"Which 17th century philosopher, mathematician, scientist, and writer provided the basis for the calculus of Newton and Leibniz by applying infinitesimal calculus to \"\"the tangent line problem\"\"?\" Context: [PAR] Education [PAR] From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School in Grantham (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He was removed from school and by Oct 1659 he was to be found at Woolsthorpe, where his mother attempted to make a farmer of him. He was, by later reports of his contemporaries, thoroughly unhappy with the work. It appears to be Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, who persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. [PAR] In June 1661 he matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge. At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler. [PAR] When Newton arrived in Cambridge in 1661, the movement now known as the scientific revolution was well advanced, and many of the works basic to modern science had appeared. Astronomers from Copernicus to Kepler had elaborated the heliocentric system of the universe. Galileo had proposed the foundations of a new mechanics built on the principle of inertia. Led by Descartes, philosophers had begun to formulate a new conception of nature as an intricate, impersonal, and inert machine. Yet as far as the universities of Europe, including Cambridge, were concerned, all this might well have never happened. They continued to be the strongholds of outmoded Aristotelianism, which rested on a geocentric view of the universe and dealt with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. [PAR] Like thousands of other undergraduates, Newton began his higher education by immersing himself in Aristotle's work. Even though the new philosophy was not in the curriculum, "

    "question": "Genever is the old word for what alcoholic drink? Context: In its homeland, it is often sold with fruit flavouring, such as orange or lemon. [PAR] Genever production [PAR] Dutch genever production traditionally centres on the town of Schiedham, near Rotterdam. In Belgium, it is produced mainly around the towns of Hasselt and Ghent. [PAR] As stated above, genever is a blend of two different spirits. [PAR] The first spirit, moutwijn (malt-wine), is what gives genever its distinctive flavour. This is a kind of unaged whiskey made by triple and sometimes quadruple pot-distilling a mixture of cereals, typically rye, corn and wheat with malted barley less commonly used. After the final distillation, the malt-wine leaves the pot still at around 47% alc./vol.: a relatively low distillation strength which yields a spirit that retains more of the malty flavours of its base ingredients. The first distillation is called 'ruwnat', the second 'enkelnat', the third 'bestnat' (actually malt wine) and the optional forth distillation 'korenijn'. [PAR] The second is produced in a very similar way to most London Dry gins. Neutral spirit (very high strength vodka) is redistilled with a recipe of botanical flavourings, most typically including juniper, coriander, caraway, orris, angelica. The result, while the flavour profile can be very different from most London Dry gins, is essentially a gin. "

[PAR] Utah and Modern day Baptists [PAR] Prior to the 18th Amendment\u2019s ratification, one of the most powerful temperance group was the Anti-Saloon League (ASL). Comprised primarily of Methodists and Baptists, the ASL was extremely adept at leveraging its congregation-based grassroots in national political campaigns. They threw their support behind \u201cdry\u201d candidates in elections and crushed the efforts of \u201cwet\u201d lawmakers. Eventually, the ASL even supported regulators in their efforts to enact a personal income tax. In return, those pro-tax politicians, such as Andrew J.
