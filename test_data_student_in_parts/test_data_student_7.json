    "question": "In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question.

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: We examined the activity of defensins, cysteine-rich cationic peptides that are abundant in the cytoplasmic granules of human and rabbit granulocytes, against various tumor targets. The three human defensins, HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, lysed human and murine targets in chromium release and dye exclusion assays. Defensin-mediated tumor cell lysis was concentration-dependent, inhibited by serum, and dependent on temperature-sensitive events. Lysis was first detected by three hours of incubation and it reached a plateau between eight and 14 hours. In vitro exposure of murine teratocarcinoma cells to HNP 1-3 abrogated their oncogenicity in vivo. Nonmalignant target cells were also susceptible to defensin-mediated lysis. Four rabbit granulocyte defensins exerted marked (NP-1, NP-2) or moderate (NP-3a, NP-3b) cytotoxic activity, whereas defensin NP-5 was not cytotoxic. When tumor cells were incubated with human defensins in combination with hydrogen peroxide, synergistic cytotoxicity was detected. As defensins are released from granulocytes by various stimuli, their release could contribute to extracellular cytotoxicity which is independent of reactive oxygen intermediates."

Abstract: From six extended-care facilities, 306 employees responded to a questionnaire on perceived life-style. Most respondents were female, married, and under age 35. The majority had had recent blood pressure checks, seldom missed work because of infections, made time for leisure activities, and felt secure in their jobs. Overall, the percentage of smokers was slightly below the national average, but 45% of the technical employees smoked. Perception of overweight and skipped meals increased with level of education. Consumption of fried foods and sweets decreased with the level of education while fiber intake increased. More skilled and technical employees than professional employees consumed milk products. Less than half of any employee group consumed excessive amounts of coffee or colas. Few study participants consumed alcohol. Very few members of any group consumed meals away from home five or more times per week. Less than half of all employees believed that they received enough exercise; one-third or less exercised regularly. A greater percentage of technical employees than of the other two employee groups expressed interest in improving health through physical fitness and class sessions."

Abstract: Children who have been sexually abused develop a variety of emotional and physical complaints, often unrelated to the genital area. Emergency department records of children diagnosed as being sexually abused were reviewed for the period covering January 1984 through June 1985. Of 26,000 patients seen, 300 cases of sexual abuse were identified. Of these, 57 were patients who presented with initial complaints other than sexual abuse. The data were analyzed for age, sex, chief complaint, time of presentation, physical findings, and person accompanying the child. The most common presenting complaints of these 57 patients were abdominal pain (26%) and vaginal symptoms (26%) The latter included pruritus, discharge, and bleeding. Other complaints included rectal bleeding or constipation (9%), chronic urinary tract infection (5%), straddle injury (4%), and suicide attempt (2%). The remaining 26% included fever, respiratory infections, sore throat, asthma, bronchitis, obesity, mastoiditis, and weight loss. Because resident physicians are instructed to conduct complete anal and genital examinations on all patients, sexual misuse was often diagnosed with seemingly unrelated complaints. A protocol developed for use in the emergency department is described."

This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

Abstract: Eighteen patients underwent computed tomography (CT) prior to total laryngectomy. In order to assess the accuracy of CT scanning in the evaluation of carcinoma of the larynx, CT scans were prospectively interpreted and the extent of the tumour was recorded. The tumour extent was evaluated on whole-mount histologic sections of the laryngeal specimens, prepared in the horizontal plane, similar to the CT scan. The results were compared to assess the ability of CT to identify tumour infiltration in the horizontal plane accurately. Based on these findings it is clear that CT has its influence on the T-staging and on the choice of treatment of laryngeal cancer, i.e. radiotherapy versus surgery."

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: A retrospective review of the cases of fifteen patients with a three-part fracture of the proximal part of the humerus is presented. Fourteen of the fractures were treated with tension-band wiring and one, with an AO buttress plate. The patients were evaluated for pain, range of motion, strength, and function of the involved shoulder and the radiographic result at an average of fifty-four months after the injury. At follow-up, the shoulders had an average of 126 degrees of active elevation, 29 degrees of active external rotation, 81 degrees of active abduction, and internal rotation to the second lumbar vertebra. The only early complication was failure of fixation in the patient who had been treated with a buttress plate. In two patients, radiographic evidence of avascular necrosis of the humeral head later developed, and one of them required revision to a hemiarthroplasty. In conclusion, we recommend operative treatment for the healthy, active individual who has a three-part fracture of the proximal part of the humerus. We found that the best results with these difficult fractures are obtained using tension-band wiring."

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and antigens (HBsAg and HBcAg) were studied in liver biopsy specimens from 105 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic liver diseases. Free or integrated viral DNA, or both, was detected in 83 of 105 (79%) patients, whereas HBsAg and HBcAg were demonstrated immunohistologically in 96 (91%) and 39 (37%), respectively. Of 60 patients with detectable free viral DNA, 38 (63%) were positive for HBcAg, whereas only 1 of 45 (2%) with either integrated viral DNA alone (n = 23) or no detectable viral DNA (n = 22) was positive for HBcAg (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, the amount of HBcAg was positively correlated with the amount of free viral DNA in the liver tissue. In contrast, HBsAg was well expressed not only in the liver with free viral DNA, but also in the liver with integrated DNA. These data suggest that the synthesis of HBcAg is primarily directed by free viral DNA, whereas that of HBsAg may be directed by free as well as integrated viral DNAs."

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: Physical activity has been associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. A mechanism for the reduced risk may be through increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and subfractions, in particular HDL2-C. Research associated with increased physical activity investigating HLD-C have assessed the effects of intense aerobic activity. The current research evaluated the relationship between low intensity, long duration activity to HDL-C and subfractions in 35 active postal carriers. Measurements of physical activity via the Large Scale Integrated monitor and reported miles walked, and lipoproteins were assessed at 3-month intervals over a 1-year period. Reported miles walked/day (5.3) was significantly correlated with HLD2-C (r = 0.50, P = 0.003) and approached significance for HDL-C (r = 0.29, P = 0.06). The Large Scale Integrated measures were correlated with HDL-C (r = 0.44, P = 0.008) and HDL2-C (r = 0.44, P = 0.007). Controlling for either age, alcohol consumption, body mass index, or leisure time activity did not reduce the relationship between reported miles walked or Large Scale Integrated readings and HDL2-C, suggesting that the increased HDL-C was the result of long duration, low intensity physical activity."

Abstract: DNA measurements yield information about the nature of cells and may provide diagnostic and prognostic information. Static cytofluorometry was performed on smears removed at microlaryngoscopy from 107 vocal cord lesions (96 patients). All stem cell lines were diploid except 3; 2 carcinomas and 1 severe dysplasia were polyploid. The mean proliferative activity (percentage of nuclei greater than diploid peak) was 2.1% for the group of epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia, 3.1% for those with moderate dysplasia, 4.0% for severe dysplasia, and 6.8% for carcinomas. Hypertetraploid cell nuclei (HT cells) were not found in epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia. Seven out of 15 patients with epithelia showing moderate dysplasia had HT cells; 5 of these patients developed a carcinoma. One of 8 without HT cells developed a severe dysplasia. Nine patients with severe dysplasia had HT cells; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years. In 14 patients without HT cells, 3 had recurrences and 1 developed a carcinoma 6 years later. HT cells were found in 15 patients with T1 & T2 carcinomas; residual carcinoma was present in 2 after radiotherapy and 4 had recurrences within 11 months. Fourteen patients with T1 & T2 carcinoma did not have any HT cells; one had residual carcinoma after radiotherapy and 3 had recurrences between 18 months and 4 years. DNA measurements and, especially, the demonstration of epithelia with HT cells prove to be of prognostic importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: Measurement characteristics of two constant velocity dynamometers (Cybex II, Lumex, Inc., NY) were evaluated at 11 selected speeds (0 to 5 rad X s-1) under various conditions of inert gravitational loading. A linear accelerometer was affixed to the lever arm. Speed settings were standardized percentages of each machine's maximum tachometer feedback voltage (0 to 100% Vfb max). Regression of Cybex transducer-observed voltages (V0) on true, i.e., expected, torques (Me) revealed that, for any static loading condition or angle, the measurement system was essentially linear and valid, although greater variance was evident for smaller torques. However, different calibrations, i.e., regression lines, were required for different speed settings. The error in predicting Me from V0 increased substantially with increased % Vfb max. Methodologies which assume constant velocity dynamic loading induce questionable, often invalid, results and inferences. Dynamic V0 represents both gravitational and inertial components. Considerable fluctuations in lever arm instantaneous velocity were ascribed to the combined influence of load and % Vfb max upon the servomotor. After computing inertia-corrected Me, calibration variability and prediction error were markedly reduced. Unexplained variability may be due to poor proximity of the Cybex transducer to the force application point. We concluded that: Cybex II should be calibrated only statically; use of an optimal filter will avoid false estimates of joint torque; inertial corrections must be applied in order to minimize potentially serious errors due to system angular acceleration; and reported muscle function relationships might be usefully re-assessed in view of these findings."

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: In principle, azoospermia has two explanations: occlusion of the duct system and serious dysfunction of the testicular parenchyma. Some cases of duct occlusion are suitable for reconstructive surgery. The authors describe a reconstructive technique based on full mobilization of a single loop of the epididymal duct as caudally as possible with two-layer side-to-end anastomosis to the vas deferens. To ensure follow-up evaluation of each anastomosis, unilateral anastomosis was done primarily. In a few cases, cross-over anastomosis was necessary. In cases of reoperation, if possible, this was performed on the same side. When the epididymal duct system was found empty, the contralateral epididymis was explored. Patients with postoperative oligozoospermia were offered a supplementary contralateral operation. From 1980 to 1984, 41 patients underwent epididymovasostomy. At follow-up evaluation, 35 (85%) presented sperms in repeated tests. Fifteen of these patients (37%) have fathered children. Patients with postoperative normospermia and no antisperm antibodies had an excellent fertility prognosis. The single-loop dissection technique provides anatomic specificity and a high percentage of patent anastomoses and does not interfere with the possibilities of reoperation."

Abstract: We have developed a new cellulose membrane in which the active hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the original cellulose fibers are masked with cationic synthetic polymers. The membrane was shown by in vitro and clinical tests to affect the activation of the complement system very little, and it retains the high dialysis efficiency, good tolerance to steam autoclave sterilization, and economical production cost characteristics of the original cellulose membrane. It thus appears that the new cellulose provides the optimum combination of qualities needed in a hemodialysis membrane."

Abstract: From 1966 to 1983, skeletal suspension was used at the Shriners Burns Institute, Galveston, Texas, for the treatment of 626 burned pediatric patients who had 1128 affected extremities. Skeletal suspension was used for 863 acutely burned extremities (76.5 per cent) to facilitate skin-grafting and in 265 extremities (23.5 per cent) for functional positioning in the surgical correction of burn-acquired deformities. In a retrospective examination of these patients, there were fifty complications (4.4 per cent) related to the skeletal suspension, of which forty-five (4.0 per cent) were infections. All infections resolved with removal of the pins or the administration of antibiotics, or both. With this established low rate of complications, skeletal suspension continues to be a useful adjunct in the care of the severely burned pediatric patient."

Abstract: The author reviewed artificial cells and their applications in hemoperfusion for chronic renal failure, poisoning, fulminant hepatic failure, removal of aluminium and iron, and metabolic assists. Other areas reviewed included artificial cells containing enzymes, multienzymes, immunosorbents, cell cultures and other areas. Artificial cells can be formed as membrane coated adsorbent or microencapsulated adsorbent, enzymes and cells. The large surface to volume relationship and the ultrathin membrane of artificial cells allows the rapid equilibration of metabolites. Artificial cells containing enzymes, ion exchange resin and activated charcoal have been used for hemoperfusion. The microencapsulated or membrane coated absorbents, enzymes, cells, immunosorbents and other material are prevented from releasing unwanted material into the circulation and prevented from adverse effects on blood cells. Because of the problem of charcoal in releasing emboli and depleting platelets we first developed coated activated charcoal hemoperfusion for clinical application. This has been used extensively in clinical studies. The artificial cell approach has also been applied to a number of other hemoperfusion approaches. The lack of space only allows this paper to summarize some of the approaches originated from this research centre."

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: Prazosin, an antagonist of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor, has been found to suppress the clinical and histologic expression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the Lewis rat. This effect appears to be specific for the alpha 1-receptor. To determine the effect of this drug on vascular permeability to serum proteins and inflammatory cells, leakage of serum proteins into the central nervous system (CNS) was measured with [125I]albumin, and quantitation of cellular inflammation was determined by an estimation of total DNA. The results show that in both actively induced and passively transferred models of the disease, treatment with prazosin significantly suppresses leakage of serum proteins into the CNS but does not significantly suppress the increase of DNA. The results of the [125I]albumin studies additionally support the conclusion that the extent of vascular permeability to serum proteins in the spinal cord is a significant correlate of clinical disease. The results of the DNA estimation were at variance with the histologic evidence of cellular infiltration. We conclude that treatment with prazosin has a significant effect on the development of vascular edema in EAE. These results additionally validate a role for the adrenergic receptor in the development of EAE, and support the hypothesis that the primary site of action of prazosin is on the vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptor."

    "question": "In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\".

The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content.

Abstract: The authors present an in-depth clinical, radiographic, and pathologic analysis of a 62-year-old man with massive bone reabsorption around the proximal femur in a total hip arthroplasty (THA). The THA was revised 13 years after implantation. Thirty millimeters of calcar resorption was noted radiographically. Evidence of stem bending was present on examination of the femoral implant, and marked wear of the acetabular cup was noted. The pathologic evaluation of removed calcar bone and cement revealed a histiocytic mass invading the bone. Intracellular and extracellular polymethylene debris was noted within the invasive mass. Evidence of fragmented methylmethacrylate cement was also present. The bone-cement interface in the excised calcar region contained segments that showed active bone remodelling around the cement without an interposed membrane. It is possible that this case of calcar resorption began with histiocytic activation and recruitment by polyethylene wear debris followed by active bone lysis. The process may be perpetuated by the fragmentation of cement, as motion occurred at the calcar bone-cement interface, and may represent an extreme example of a process occurring in cases of calcar resorption in general."

Abstract: The effect of tauroursodeoxycholate (TU) infusion on the plasma level and biliary transport maximum (Tm) of sulfobromophthalein (BSP) was examined in male rats during a continuous intravenous infusion of BSP with different TU infusion rates. The infusion rate of 0.6 mumol/min/100 gm body weight of TU caused significantly higher bile flow and BSP Tm values compared with the respective control values in rats with only a BSP infusion. These values, however, were significantly lower than values obtained by an equimolar infusion of taurocholate (TC). The higher infusion rates of TU (1.2 and 1.8 mumol/min/100 gm) tended to cause higher bile flow rates, but the BSP Tm value did not increase beyond the value obtained at the lower infusion rate (0.6 mumol/min/100 gm). In the highest TU infusion rate study (1.8 mumol/min/100 gm), plasma BSP concentrations were significantly higher than corresponding control values or values at a lower TU or TC infusion rate. It was concluded that in rats TU can significantly increase the BSP Tm, but to a lesser extent than TC. Furthermore, it was suggested that TU infusion at a higher rate significantly interferes with the hepatic uptake (or storage) of BSP."

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) beta subunit curve of normal singleton in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancies shows cyclic peaks during the first 56 days after embryo transfer (ET). This phenomenon is not demonstrable in normal spontaneous conceptions. The hCG curves of 151 singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of two, three, and four embryos therefore were compared statistically with the hCG curves of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of only one embryo. The hCG levels of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of more than one embryo had statistically higher hCG levels at 7 and 8, 19 and 20, and 37 and 38 days after ET. In a separate evaluation it was observed that declines in hCG levels of normal singleton IVF pregnancies preceded four of five first-trimester abortion incidence peaks of singleton IVF pregnancies. The observed cyclic hCG secretion may be indicative of early embryo deaths. This observation supports the contention that multiple ET results in significantly more multiple implantations than previously appreciated. Thus embryo survival in utero may represent another major contributory factor to success or failure of IVF."

In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\".

The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content.

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: A mathematical model was constructed to predict motor performance in rats for 8 weeks after spinal cord injury. The model is based on experimental data generated from an investigation of the static-load technique of inducing cord injury and was derived using multiple linear regression. The regression coefficients for weight of the injury-producing load were statistically significant (P less than 0.001), and it was found that the weight of the load contributes over 95% of the posttrauma motor deficit, whereas the time duration of the load resting on the cord contributes less than 5% to the deficit. Sex, pretrauma motor performance, and pretrauma body weight are insignificant covariates. The model may be used to establish expected motor deficits and to derive dose-response curves."

If Troncoso occasionally tips his hand, as _he_does when Helmut self-consciously asks ``What was morality anyway?'', or when the street-wise Rosselli puts forth a rather academic-sounding theory of racial division, the author is careful never to make the conflict between his characters' ``truths'' too explicit. <sep>, Pronoun: he <sep>, A: Helmut <sep>, B: Rosselli"

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: We examined the effectiveness of instruments that describe a child's locus of control and perceived self-competence as predictors of outcome in the treatment of encopresis. Fifty children 9 to 12 years of age completed such instruments prior to clinical interview. Clinicians were blind as to the results of these questionnaires and administered a standard encopresis protocol to all patients. Six to 17 months later, 45 (90%) of the patient's parents were interviewed to assess compliance and treatment outcome. Children who significantly improved had a more internal locus of control (P less than 0.05) and better compliance (P less than 0.05) as determined by two separate outcome variables. Locus of control and compliance were not, however, significantly correlated with each other; each appeared to have an independent association with outcome. There was no association between perceived self-competence and outcome. The positive association between locus of control and outcome was not mediated by socioeconomic status, age, duration of encopresis, severity of encopresis, gender, or time between initiation of treatment and follow-up. Measurement of locus of control in children with encopresis appears to be helpful in identifing a group at high risk for resistance of treatment."

Abstract: Thirty legs in nineteen patients, eleven with bilateral and eight with unilateral chronic anterior-compartment syndrome, were treated by fasciotomy. In addition, five of these patients (six legs) had compression of the superficial peroneal nerve: two before and three after fasciotomy. One patient also had lateral compartment syndrome in one leg. The patients who had compression of the superficial peroneal nerve were relieved by partial fasciectomy and fasciotomy of the lateral compartment. In one of these patients, with bilateral nerve compression, both superficial peroneal nerves were anomalous. The patient who had lateral compartment syndrome was relieved by fasciotomy of this compartment. Two patients required a second fasciotomy due to recurrence of the chronic compartment syndrome. At an average length of follow-up of twenty-five months after fasciotomy for anterior compartment syndrome, functional capacity was unlimited or increased in eighteen patients (twenty-eight legs) and was unchanged in one patient (two legs) who had had compression of the superficial peroneal nerve. The intramuscular pressures in the anterior compartment were normal at rest as well as during and after exercise eight months after the original fasciotomy in twenty-eight legs and eight months after the second fasciotomy in two legs."

The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: To better understand declining autopsy rates, data have been gathered prospectively on 1080 consecutive deaths over six years among patients admitted to a medical intensive care/coronary care unit. Overall autopsy rate was 36%. Autopsy rates declined sharply with age from 60% for those aged 16 to 34 years to 23% for those 85 and over (P less than .001). The highest rates by diagnosis were aortic aneurysm (70%), hepatic failure (52%), heart rhythm disturbance (48%), pulmonary embolism (45%), and sepsis (41%). Patients receiving major procedures had a significantly higher autopsy rate (38 versus 29%, P less than .05) but rates bore little relation to prognoses given at admission by house officers, suddenness of death, sex, marital status or year of admission. Even among intensively treated patients, autopsy rates decline strikingly with age, demanding honest re-appraisal to restore the place of autopsy in medical education, clinical research, and quality of care assessment for an increasingly elderly population."

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: The authors have investigated the application of mode-locked and Q-switched Neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) lasers in ocular surgery by means of high-speed photography and hydrophone measurements. The incisive effect relies on the optical breakdown at the laser focus. Cavitation bubbles and acoustic transients are thereby generated. Their size and pressure amplitude have been measured at various laser-pulse energies. With a pulse energy of 5 mJ, the bubble is 1.5 to 2.3 mm in diameter and the pressure of the acoustic transient is 9 to 16 bar (130 to 230 psi) at a distance of 18 mm from the focal point. Bubble size and amplitude of the pressure pulse are always approximately 50% higher with a Q-switched laser than with a mode-locked laser. However, the size of the ruptures produced in a polyethylene membrane by the laser pulses is the same for both modes of operation. The energy balance shows that not only mechanical effects, but also thermal mechanisms are responsible for photodisruption."

    "question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper. Abstract: The ability of several surface-active agents to stimulate the humoral immune response in mice against haptenated liposomes was tested. The surfactants were block copolymers of hydrophilic polyoxyethylene (POE) and hydrophobic polyoxypropylene (POP) that differed in m.w., percentage of POE, and mode of linkage of POP to POE. The liposomes were haptenated with tripeptide-enlarged dinitrophenyl coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine, which was incorporated into the liposomal membrane. Additional injection of mice with surfactant stimulated serum hemagglutination titers and splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC) numbers to varying extents. Block polymers with POP chains flanking a POE center, as well as polymers with POE chains flanking a POP center, displayed high adjuvant activity. These block polymers stimulated the antibody response in a dose-dependent manner. They stimulated the antibody response with both high and low antigen doses. Furthermore, the addition of one of these adjuvants (25R1) reduced the amount of carrier lipid required in the liposome in order to obtain an optimal antibody response. The surfactants, which displayed high adjuvant activity, did not interfere with liposome stability as measured with a liposome lysis assay. Moreover, in vitro preincubation of liposomes with a block polymer did not affect their immunogenicity. Optimal adjuvant activity was observed when both adjuvant and liposomes were administered by the same route. Simultaneous injection of both components, however, is not a prerequisite. Conclusively, it can be stated that nonionic block polymer surfactants are potent adjuvants for stimulation of the antibody response against haptenated liposomes."
